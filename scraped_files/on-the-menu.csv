on-the-menu,Fad Diets: Lo-Carb High Fat Pros & Cons,18-Jan-18,12:10 AM,['Marisa Ratchford'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/fad-diets-lo-carb-high-fat-pros-cons/,"The new year brings in new resolutions, and those often lead to changes in diet and health. Often, a trendy diet or a superfood that will solve all of your problems seems to be the answer, and that may be so. I, too, have fallen into the trap of those crazy fad diets in the past, and more often than not I end up failing miserably at them. I obviously enjoy food and dining out, and I have a strong bond with food; otherwise, I wouldn't be here every week talking to you about my latest craving or restaurant find. If you're anything like me and calorie counting is a joke and meal prepping the same meal for every day of the week makes your insides hurt, then perhaps you should look into a diet with fewer restrictions that still has great results. I give you the lo-carb, high fat (LCHF) diet, otherwise known as the keto diet. Marisa Ratchford / Daily Nexus What is considered LCHF? This diet is simple in its restrictions: avoid fruits, grains, pasta, starch and vegetables that grow underground like potato. Foods that should be consumed are poultry, meat, eggs , fish, cheese and natural fats like butter and lots of vegetables. There is no need to calorie count or restrict portions; eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full. It's as simple as that. Another plus is that there is no reason to buy artificial or specialty foods to maintain this diet, as it's natural and easy to prepare. How does it work? Many of you may be skeptical because your mother has probably warned you of the dangers of butter, cheese and bacon your whole life, and every time you ingest a cheese stick you helplessly panic and wait for cellulite to appear on your thighs. So how could bacon possibly help you lose weight? Well, when your body is consuming carbohydrates, it will use these easy molecules for energy, but when a lack of carbohydrates is present, the body will turn to its stored fats and break those down for energy, thus burning fat and shedding pounds. Is it safe? A state of ketosis can be beneficial to your weight loss, but it is important to know that any sort of restricting diet comes with its health risks. It is not recommended for those who suffer from diabetes or high cholesterol, or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. And if nutrients and vitamins are not either supplemented or monitored in your diet, improper nutrition can lead to many health risks including dizziness, nausea, dehydration, constipation and, in serious cases, kidney stones and gout. It is definitely not something to do without proper advisement and correct nutritional levels. Will the weight stay off? Like any fad diet, LCHF works as intended during use but when reverting back from ketosis, weight gain is likely to happen. Your body has been burning all of its stored fat resources, so once it has a new source of fuel for energy (carbohydrates), it begins to want to store fat once again. Water weight gain can also occur. The important thing to remember is that diets do not keep the weight off. They help lose weight quickly and rapidly, but in order to create permanent results, you need to make lifestyle changes like permanent amends to your diet and exercise regimens. Verdict? Ketosis definitely doesn't work for everyone, and many health advisors would say that the risks outweigh the benefits, but for rapid results with minimal restrictions, this diet does work. I've personally tried it and lost five pounds in a week, but my Irish roots' love for potatoes always sneaks back up and causes a lapse in ketosis, making it impossible to keep results consistent. The important thing I've taken away from my experiences with LCHF is not to be carb-restricted but rather carb-conscious. I'm eating better, I'm cooking more of my meals and I'm still feeling satisfied. Whether you want to go extreme or just try and make tweaks to your habits, it's always important to find a balance that works for you and makes you happy.

on-the-menu,Make Ahead Breakfast,18-Jan-18,12:15 AM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/make-ahead-breakfast/,"Making time for breakfast proves to be a daily battle, one I seem to constantly overlook until I'm running out the door on another empty stomach. For some reason, I always overestimate the amount of time and energy I'll have in the morning. Past-me seems to have a great deal more faith in future-me than I deserve. So, if you're looking not to hate yourself in the morning and instead save yourself some time, here are a few recipes you can easily prepare the night before and warm up before you head out to class. Kevin Chan / Daily Nexus Apple Cinnamon Overnight Oats Ω cup rolled oats
Ω cup almond milk
1 tsp maple syrup
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 small chopped apple Mix all the ingredients and store in sealed mason jars in the refrigerator overnight. Grab in the morning and enjoy on the go. Breakfast Egg Muffins 9 eggs
1 cup chopped spinach
1 cup cheddar cheese
1 cup chopped cooked ham
1/2 cup chopped green pepper Preheat oven to 375 degrees and spray a muffin pan with cooking spray. Whisk the eggs together in a bowl, adding salt and pepper to taste. Divide the egg evenly among the muffin tins. Add and stir in the spinach, cheese, ham and green pepper. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the egg is set, storing in the refrigerator for later or enjoying once they have cooled. Freezer Croissant Sandwiches 6 mini croissants
Thinly sliced ham
Slices of cheddar cheese (or cheese of your personal preference)
3 large eggs Crack and whisk the eggs in a bowl, adding salt and pepper to taste. Pour eggs into a lightly oiled pan and cook over medium high heat. Gently stir and fold until firm. Cut the mini croissants in half and fill with the egg, ham and cheese to make sandwiches. Wrap the sandwiches in plastic wrap and store in the freezer. In the morning, unwrap and warm the sandwiches in the microwave for 1-2 minutes or until heated completely. Yogurt Bites 2 cups Greek yogurt
2 cups granola
1 cup mixed berries Line the bottom of each muffin tin with granola. Add in the Greek yogurt over the top of the granola, sprinkling a few berries over the top of each muffin tin. Place in the freezer for a couple of hours until the yogurt is firm, and enjoy. Pancake Muffins Pancake mix
1 cup water
1 cup chocolate chips Prepare the pancake mix according to the instructions, incorporating the chocolate chips at the end. Scoop the pancake batter into a muffin pan until each tin is approximately two-thirds of the way full. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until golden. Let cool and drizzle with maple syrup. (Feel free to chop up some breakfast sausages and incorporate them into the batter for a more filling treat).

on-the-menu,Cast-Iron Skillet Care 101,25-Jan-18,12:41 AM,['Marisa Ratchford'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/cast-iron-skillet-care-101/,"This past Christmas, I received a set of three cast-iron skillets and have since become obsessed. If properly cared for, a cast-iron skillet will last you generations and become the only thing you need in your kitchen. If I had to choose one tool to take with me on my deserted island, it would probably be my skillet. A natural non-stick that produces even heat and dynamic flavor, your skillet is likely to become your best friend in the kitchen. However, cast-iron î as tough as it is î needs to be treated right if one day your grandchild is going to be able to use it. Here are some tips on how to keep it in tip-top shape. Courtesy of flickr.com Seasoning your skillet? Most modern cast-iron skillets come pre-seasoned, yet this still usually isn't enough. I noticed that the skillets weren't quite seasoned well enough, and therefore the food still stuck. So, to re-season the pre-season, I recommend doing another layer. Take your skillet and coat it in a thin layer of vegetable shortening or oil all over. Wipe away the excess oil, and then bake at 400 degrees for an hour. Keep it dry and clean! Your skillet should be cleaned very quickly after use. It should be cooled to just warm, and then you can use hot water, a scour brush and coarse salt to clean it. DON'T EVER USE SOAP. The soap will strip the precious layer of seasoning you've built and won't allow the pan to keep its non-stick nature. Don't be afraid! Cast-irons seem intimidating at first because of all the rules, but the more you use it, the more you'll be comfortable with it. The more often it gets used, the better it will work because the non-stick layer will become uniform and the aromatic flavors trapped in the seasoning and the iron will become more fragrant and appetizing. Where should you keep it? Your skillet should be kept in a cool, dry place. Many people will attach a hook to the inside of a cupboard and hang their skillets for ease of access and proper storage. The most important commandments to remember for your cast-iron are season, clean, dry. It can be very easy if you remember these words. A cast-iron is so versatile; whether you're just starting to develop your kitchen arsenal or you're trying to expand your utensils, the cast-iron will be a great addition.

on-the-menu,Cuernavaca Cuisine,25-Jan-18,12:47 AM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/cuernavaca-cuisine/,"Settled on W Carrillo Street and De La Vina Street, across the street from Starbucks and Rusty's Pizza Parlor, is one of Taqueria Cuernavaca's three locations along the Southern California Coast. Offering great and authentic Mexican food at a reasonably low price, Taqueria Cuernavaca sets itself apart from some of the more run-of-the-mill options we typically come across in Goleta. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus My friend had initially insisted upon trying the place out after a day spent shopping on State Street, having come across it on more than one occasion but never managing to actually try the place out. So with me in tow, we made our way inside. The menu boasted the usual classics, along with platters such as enchiladas and pozole. Rather than going for the usual tacos or burrito, I opted for gorditas de tinga. At times resembling a stuffed tortilla pocket, the restaurant's resembled more of a sandwich. The gordita entailed a thick tortilla that had been cooked on a comal, cut and then filled with meat and assorted toppings. With chipotle-marinated shredded chicken, lettuce, sour cream and cotija cheese all nestled between two homemade tortillas, my mouth was watering before the plate of gorditas had even been set before me. The spiciness of the chicken was nicely offset by the other ingredients' milder flavors, allowing for a kick of heat without wishing I had ordered a second drink. Juicy and overall nicely flavored, it was one of the best dishes I've had since coming to Santa Barbara. As someone who is forever homesick for L.A. taco trucks, that's a big statement to make. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus My friend took a different approach with the torta de asada, declaring it her go-to menu item at Mexican restaurants. Tortas typically entail a long, firm sandwich roll that is grilled or toasted and served with meat and a variety of garnishes inside. The torta consisted of refried beans, avocado, tomatoes, cheese and steak sandwiched inside two slices of telera bread. In the case of my friend, the torta also included a healthy helping of salsa verde, lemon and jalape√±o. Judging by the smile on her face and the rather empty plate left behind, I would say the torta met her standards. I've gone back twice since initially eating there, and I've yet to be able to pick something else off the menu; my stomach just can't justify leaving a good thing behind. So for now, I'm in a happy committed relationship with Taqueria Cuernavaca and their extremely delicious gorditas. It's a good thing that both the 24X and my friend's car drop me off right by the restaurant so I can continue feeding my addiction. At least it's not fast food.

on-the-menu,America's Favorite Food Flops,31-Jan-18,12:13 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/americas-favorite-food-flops/,"We've all experienced shortcomings, and the Museum of Failure perfectly succeeds in showcasing a vast array of failures that we can all probably relate to. It was inspired by the infamous Museum of Failure in Helsingborg, Sweden that presents a collection of failed innovations and ideas. The American adaptation is located in the Downtown Arts District in L.A. in the A+D Museum and just recently opened in the beginning of December. This museum displays some of the world's most hilarious and interesting failures in technology, As Seen on TVù inventions and, most importantly, food. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The museum features a whole exhibit dedicated to failed food products. Some of these products include Colgate's pre-packaged boxed dinner of beef lasagna from the '80s. That's right. Beef lasagna from America's leading toothpaste brand. It's no wonder that this food product earned its place in the Museum of Failure. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus In the breakfast department, the museum displayed a box of Kellogg's OJ's Cereal, also from the '80s. One of the most cringe-worthy combinations is probably cereal and orange juice, so imagine combining those two things and eating them with milk. Nobody's really sure why anyone thought this was a good idea, but it's a good thing it was taken off the shelves one year after it was released. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus One of the other food products that made it onto the museum's displays was the 2006 coffee-flavored Coke, Coca-Cola Blak, which was literally just Diet Coke mixed with coffee. There was also a can of fat-free Pringles, which were introduced in the late '90s, that was made with Olestra, a fat substitute that gave America diarrhea. But out of all these different failed food inventions, the one that stood out the most was the wall of flavored Oreos that were arranged in a way that spelled out a big, fat Fù. Some people love Oreo's new flavors, but aside from the Double Stuf and mint, the rest of them are pretty wack. The museum kind of makes you think if Swedish Fish and blueberry pie really need be made into Oreo flavors. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus So if you're in the L.A. area, be sure to stop by the Museum of Failure and check out these failed food inventions, as well as everything else it has to offer. The museum will stay open for an extended amount of time until Feb. 18 due to popular demand, so grab your tickets now!

on-the-menu,Going Deep: Scoring the Best Place To Watch the Super Bowl,1-Feb-18,12:40 AM,['Marisa Ratchford'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/going-deep-scoring-the-best-place-to-watch-the-super-bowl/,"Like many of my fellow college students living in Isla Vista, utility payments become a sense of necessity. Sure, I pay for high-speed Wi-Fi, electricity and of course Spotify Premium, but cable is not something I'm willing to cough up the big bucks for. Going home to Mom and Dad's usually results in me binge-watching garbage TV that I can't stream, live action news or, if you're like my family, sports. So with the Super Bowl coming up this Sunday, Feb. 2, and me having no time or money to head home for the big game, I have to figure out the places I can go to get a decent meal and a flat-screen TV.
So if you happen to be in the same boat as me, aimlessly looking for the perfect parlor or swanky sports bar to park your caboose in, then this article is something you're going to want to read. Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus Comfort is close to home, so if you're planning on staying in Isla Vista for the big game, then you have a few options.
The first place that you'll likely want to check out is Woodstock's Pizza. They have several high-def TVs strategically located around the restaurant, and for those just trying to enjoy the crowds, they have outdoor patio seating. On Sunday they will be providing their All-You-Can-Eat slices for $8.95 a person and a mega party deal that includes three extra-large combo pizzas and two 18-count wing party packs for $100 even. Be sure to get there early, though, because even on a regular football night it can get pretty packed. Sam's To Go will also be hosting the game, and the owner suggested that nothing is set in stone, but they may be offering select beers for 99 cents. Either way, the restaurant has great, filling sandwiches and plenty of outdoor communal seating. Dublin's and Pizza My Heart will also be broadcasting the games and offering their standard happy hour drink pricing. Dublin's is offering $5 well drinks and $9 pitchers of Rolling Rock and Bud Light, while PMH will have their $3.50 jars of Long Hammer. Venture out a bit further into the wild world of Goleta and you'll find yourself some proper sports bars and breweries that are the perfect post-up spots. M. Special is broadcasting the game and offering $1 off pints during the game. High Sierra Bar and Grill will be hosting its standard NFL happy hour menu with premium quality appetizers and down-n-dirty grub ranging from $3 to $8 an order. Domestic beer is $5 for a 22 oz. or $13 for a pitcher. Import is $6 for 22 oz. or $18 for a pitcher. Well drinks, margaritas, house wines and shots are all $5. Specialty cocktails, premium shots and select shooters are priced at $6.
However, if you're looking for fun for a group of sports-fanatics to Super Bowl snackers alike, then Zodo's is where it is happening. Their crazy Super Bowl party kicks off at 2 p.m. and offers $3 everything. Bowling games, shoe rentals and 50 arcade tokens are all $3 each per person. Food deals include hot dogs, pizza and tater tots all for $3 each. Libations can either be consumed as Bud Light pints or Modelo bottles for, you guessed it, $3! You're likely to find many sports bars along State Street and sporadically around the Funk Zone hosting the game. Most of these places are first come first serve and offer their standard menus, but if you're looking for more of a VIP experience, then for $50 you can gain access to the Baja Sharkeez Super Bowl party and open bar. Tickets must be purchased online but include cover charge and bar.

on-the-menu,Rooting for the Brew,1-Feb-18,12:47 AM,['Marisa Ratchford'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/rooting-for-the-brew/,"For most of-age viewers of the Super Bowl, whether you're an avid fan or watching solely for the commercials, a cold beer is just as important as the quarterback to your enjoyment of the game. The beer you drink should reflect the experience you wish to have and the outcome you hope to witness. Depending on who you are rooting for, here are two different cheap beers that will hopefully fit your experience as tightly as a lineman's pants. Kevin Son / Daily Nexus If you're rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles, drink¶.. Trader Joe's Simpler Times Lager: 
The Philadelphia Eagles have long been a team revered as the underdog. They've had exceptional seasons and broken records that wouldn't have been assumed to be doable by the franchise, yet they've also had some slumps in success and have had few Super Bowl championships î counting three in total î despite their long history. This humble yet classic team deserves a beer of equal merit. Invoking the blue-collar days of a pastime, Trader Joe's Simpler Time's Lager will not knock your socks off with its hypnotic-hops of Grade A organic fair-trade hipster bullshit often done today, but it is a simple, straight-to-the-point dad's beer. It goes down smooth and refreshes you like water. This is a beer you'd want to chug ice cold after a hard day's work, and even better, it's just $3.99 for a six-pack. If you're rooting for the New England Patriots, drink¶ Trader Joe's Boatswain American Double IPA:
If you're either a long-time fan trying to prove your validity or a bandwagoner just banking off the probability of a win from last year's results, you probably already know that the Pat's are the football franchise of the modern age. They've got the all-star QB and the All-American appeal with just the right amount of scandal and success to make them known by even the most naive of sports fans. A team like this requires a bit more restraint when drinking, meaning you want something for sipping rather than chugging. A Double IPA is just what you need. It's just the right amount of pretentiousness for a team that's attended eight Super Bowls and won five of them, all of which were with the same head coach and quarterback, and has surpassed countless other records. Need I say more? It's also a tad more expensive, as a super-franchise should be, with the six-pack boasting a $4.99 price tag.

Hardcore and bandwagon fans alike can agree that any football game, especially the Super Bowl, just isn't the same without an unhealthy amount of food. Now, while you can take the easy route and order half a dozen boxes of pizza, you can also be a winner in your own right by impressing your friends with some Vince Lombardi Trophy-worthy snacks.

Once cooked, coat the meatballs in warmed buffalo sauce (or your desired hot sauce), and serve with toothpicks for easy snacking. Loaded Tater Tot Skewers

Ω cup chopped cooked bacon
º cup diced chives
º cup tomato
2 cups sour cream (for dipping)

on-the-menu,Dinner Date at Outpost,8-Feb-18,12:20 AM,['Marisa Ratchford'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/dinner-date-at-outpost/,"Next Wednesday is the time to wine and dine your boo. Although most of us consider splitting nachos a romantic gesture, sometimes it's necessary to class it up a bit. You and your partner need to get snazzy and then get grubbin'. Luckily for you, if you're looking for fine dining, Santa Barbara has a myriad of options to choose from. In fact, there are so many options that it can almost immobilize you. So I'm here to bestow all my dining expertise and give you my ultimate date night location. Whether it be for Valentine's day or another special occasion, if you're looking for a delicious and price-worthy restaurant, look no further than the Goodland Hotel's Outpost. Marisa Ratchford / Daily Nexus Located just up the street from the Calle Real Center, it's close by while still allowing escape from the drab of Isla Vista and providing a separate and more sophisticated ambience. The restaurant has a beach hacienda vibe and just the perfect touch of retro flare. With dim localized lighting, ornate clay pottery and lush green flora, the cool yet vibrant colors of the restaurant and incandescent candlelight help create a nouveau riche atmosphere that oozes exoticism and romance while maintaining that hip Beach-Boys vibe. The patrons are both formal yet lax, allowing for a feeling of elegance without feeling stiff. The dining area itself is modest in size but open and airy. In the central back is the bar, offering an ever-changing, locally sourced and vibrantly fresh cocktail menu along with local crafted wines and beer for the 21+ crowd. The restaurant's menu focuses heavily on Californian cuisine, specifically its fresh and diverse components. The executive chef James Siao finds a clever and unique way to fuse Asian and Latin inspired flavors into a plate that will stun the senses and inspire creativity. I had the unique opportunity to sample a wide range of options from the menu to give you a better chance of finding the perfect dish to accompany your perfect night. I started the night with one of their seasonal cocktails called The Good Mule, consisting of Grey Goose vodka, Meyer lemon lavender cordial and ginger. It's safe to say that this cocktail was one of the most delicious things I've ever had in my life. Unfortunately for you this was the Autumn drink and isn't offered at this time on their menu; however, if you were looking to imbibe, I suggest one of their classics, The Aviation: Beefeater gin, Luxardo maraschino, fresh lemon and cr√®me de violet. Marisa Ratchford / Daily Nexus On to appetizers; I tried a few options, and my two favorites had to be the burrata plate î which consisted of a creamy burrata cheese that was rich and velvety and complemented by a carrot jam î broccoli salad, pumpkin pesto and toasted bread. The sweetness of the jam was pleasant and a different taste than my normal cravings. It was light enough to leave room for the rest of the meal but substantial enough to possess flavor. However, the best appetizer had to be the fried cauliflower. The dish is served with a head of tender cauliflower, caper aioli, charred lemon and t≈çgarashi crunchy garlic. The smoky lemon made the dish phenomenal, melding all the flavors into a bright, creamy, garlicky delight. The best part is that for every order of the dish, $2 gets donated to No Kid Hungry. I then moved on to lighter plates that could be ordered if you were not that hungry or wanted a heavier appetizer. The crispy chicken wings were very moist and had a kick of flavor. They are served with a garlic, ginger, jalape√±o and chili vinaigrette and are something that even the most reserved of diners can enjoy. The star, however, was the mussels plate: fresh local mussels served in a red curry coconut broth with braised leeks and a grilled baguette. The mussels were superbly cooked but it was really all about the broth. I could have ordered just a bowl of that and chugged it because it was so aromatic and flavorful while still being light and warm. Then I moved onto the entr√©es, although I was getting dangerously full. The roasted sea bass lettuce wraps were a fun and tasty way to split a plate. The plate is served with a filet of seabass, some large lettuce pieces, crispy shallots, local greens, herbs and Vietnamese dipping sauce. The fresh herbs pair really well with the acidic vinegar of the dipping sauce, and the plating allows for customization and easy sharing. If you're willing to shell out the big bucks, though, the strip steak served with a poblano parsnip pur√©e, marinated wild mushrooms, chimichurri and crispy onions is quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. Served at a perfect medium rare, the juicy steak pairs so well with the bright pur√©e and earthy mushrooms. Even though I was near maximum stomach capacity, I finished every last bit of this dish. Marisa Ratchford / Daily Nexus As for dessert, although I didn't get to try it, I was strongly tempted to try their Mexican-spiced chocolate pudding or their fried carrot cake. Both were huge reasons I plan to return again. So if you are looking for a restaurant with flare and flavor for your special someone, check out the Outpost at The Goodland Hotel.

on-the-menu,The Sweetest Story,8-Feb-18,12:28 AM,['Morgan Bakowsky'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/the-sweetest-story/,"Is that a chocolate bar in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
February 14: a day once considered religious turned into a day of gift giving and adoration. Valentine's Day is a day of romance, seduction and CHOCOLATE. But why is chocolate such a big part of the holiday? Many know that chocolate is considered an aphrodisiac, but the history of its use on Valentine's Day is a longer story. Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus Where does this sexy treat come from, anyway?
Chocolate is made from cacao beans, which are mainly grown in Latin America. During the age of the Aztecs, chocolate was considered a luxury that was consumed by royalty regularly and by other elite on special occasions such as marriage. Typically, it was consumed in a way similar to modern hot cocoa, except it was made with chili peppers instead of sugar. The drink was associated with the Aztec goddess of fertility, Xochiquetzal, so it was drank by newlyweds to increase seduction and fertility. When did it become a V-Day thing?
Eventually Christopher Columbus discoveredù chocolate along with Latin America and brought it to Europe, where it was turned sweet and became a pretty big deal. By the time Valentine's Day became a romantic holiday in the mid-1800s, chocolate was quite a popular commodity, and a man named Richard Cadbury saw the opportunity to profit off of it even more than before. He started marketing it for Valentine's Day in heart-shaped boxes that could then be used for storing romantic mementos and other small but meaningful things. Russell Stover then took Cadbury's idea of decorating chocolate boxes in a sexy way, further driving up the consumption rate. The tradition of buying and gifting chocolate on the day of love became even more popular in the United States when it became a symbol of sexiness in film. It was common to see a woman lounging around eating a box of chocolates to show that she had sex appeal. This made chocolate less of the romantic and erotic treasure of the past and more the commercial commodity that it is today. So, whether you have a valentine or are your own valentine, chocolate is unanimously associated with the holiday. It can either be perceived as a sensual aphrodisiac or just another capitalist ploy, but regardless, it sure does taste good.

Now the real dilemma begins. Your friends have all ordered. The waiter's gaze falls onto you expectantly with his pen poised above his notepad. Wait, how did this happen? You need more time. Your heart rate speeds up. Sweat beads your upper lip. You debate whether or not it's socially acceptable to book it out of the restaurant, but you know the real question isn't, Do I want pancakes or eggs Benedict?ù It's, Do I want something sweet or savory?ù Eventually, you go with your gut (or more accurately, your taste receptors) and order the¶  Christine Kim / Daily Nexus Whichever option you choose says a lot about your general taste preferences. Being born with a major sweet tooth, I've always been more partial toward the saccharine side of life, choosing cookies over potato chips, chocolate over French fries and red velvet pancakes over Florentine Benedicts. Working in an ice cream shop in high school only enabled my borderline sugar addiction, and whenever someone asks if I want to get ice cream or frozen yogurt, my reaction is significantly more excited than if the same person were to ask if I wanted to get pizza or tacos. Although I, like most people, do have cravings for foods at the other end of the flavor spectrum, I've always wondered why humans tend to have a strong inclination to choose one over the other.
 Not surprisingly, the types of flavors we prefer are largely dependent on genetics: Our unique combination of genes determines taste sensitivity and the number of taste buds we have, which is usually around 10,000. Our preferences also depend on the types of food we grew up eating and the experiences we associate with those foods. If you had pretzels in your school lunch bag every day and enjoyed buttery popcorn at the movies with your parents, you might have developed a craving for salty foods. If your favorite memories include decadent chocolate cake for all of your birthdays or milkshakes with your middle school teammates after a soccer game, you might have developed a strong sweet tooth. Could my infatuation with ice cream derive from my fond childhood memories of walking to the nearby ice cream shop to get raspberry sorbet with my dad? Makes sense to me! Additionally, the more accustomed to one flavor we become, the more we continue to want to eat it. Looks like I won't be switching to the savory side anytime soon. Whether you prefer the Dole Whip or fried pickles at Disneyland, an Icee or popcorn at the movies or frozen yogurt or French fries for a late-night snack, you can now understand the science behind your choices. So, what side are you on? Team Sweet or Team Savory?

Goodbye avocados and cutesy cupcakes, and hello Tide Pods! Taking the internet by storm, this latest craze has everyone and their mother challenging each other to bite into the colorful, juicy laundry detergent packets. But why simply take a bite out of a Tide Pod or two when they have so much more potential? Here are some ways to incorporate then versatile pod into your daily meals. Kalani Seaman / Daily Nexus Breakfast:
Adding these vitamin-and-mineral-packed pods to your most important meal of the day is obviously a must. Instead of cracking open two eggs onto your frying pan, try this: pour egg whites onto a lightly oiled pan. Then, place a Tide Pod at the center. Fry for a minute on each side. In lieu of your run-of-the-mill yellow yolk, you get a symphony of orange, blue and white. Next, toast a piece of bread (bagels and English muffins work just as well) to golden perfection. Cut open a Tide Pod and spread the contents evenly over your toast. Simple and quick î no wonder so many Americans are starting their days the Tide Pods way!
Lunch:
A hearty lunch is crucial to getting you through your jam-packed schedule, and a classic lunchtime favorite is the meatball sub. Yet you might be realizing that your totally Instagrammable sandwich blends right in with the other mundane meals on the Explore page. Replacing the meatballs with Tide Pods will give your cooking creation the kick it needs to go from mainstream to social media sensation. Cut a baguette in half lengthwise and hollow out some of the
inside for a place to hold your pods. Brush the baguette with olive oil and
season with garlic and salt. Place in a preheated oven until lightly toasted. Dip your Tide Pods into spaghetti sauce and place on the bread. Cover with slices of provolone, bake until the cheese melts and enjoy!
Dinner:
As you continue reading for more Tide Pod inspiration to prepare your final meal of the day, perhaps consider some spaghetti and Tide Pods or a Tide Pod and veggie stir fry. You may start to realize your mouth and esophagus are burnt and swollen. Breathing may be significantly more difficult than normal.
Is that an ulcer you feel forming? I guess the only thing on the menu tonight will be a trip to the emergency room.
Disclaimer: Please for the love of all that is good in the world, do not actually consume Tide Pods. Seriously. You're better than that.

Dumplings symbolize wealth because they are made in the shape of Chinese silver ingots, and legend has it that the more dumplings you eat, the more money you will make during the year. Chun Juan (Spring Rolls) Spring rolls also symbolize wealth and prosperity because their golden-yellow color makes them look like gold bars. This dish is popular even in Western cultures, but traditional-style spring rolls are filled with carrots, shiitake mushrooms, cabbage, bean sprouts and pork and are deep-fried and eaten with soy sauce.

on-the-menu,Holy Ham! Should You Remove Pork From Your Dinner Plate?,22-Feb-18,12:19 AM,['Morgan Bakowsky'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/holy-ham-should-you-remove-pork-from-your-dinner-plate/,"For the last three years and three months I have been a vegetarian. Aside from a few moments where I was unaware of chicken broth in certain restaurant foods, I have not had any actual slip-ups. As I emotionally prepare to start eating meat again soon, I am thinking about just how much of it I am going to incorporate into my diet. After much thought and research, I have come to one clear conclusion: I will not eat pork. Here are five reasons why you should reconsider eating pork as well. Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus 1. Factory pigs are filthy
Pigs are very clean animals in nature. When they have plenty of space to live, they separate the place where they defecate from the places they drink water, cool off and eat. However, they do not have sweat glands. This means that they overheat easily, so to alleviate this they roll in mud like many other thick-skinned animals. Pigs that live on small farms and in the wild do this without problem; however, the pigs that are processed for consumption in the United States are often forced to do all of this in one small space. This leaves them susceptible to reabsorbing anything that they excrete, including but not limited to: bacteria, toxins, disease, worms, common allergens and parasites. Even though they have clean habits, they are the farm animal that carries the most of these things in general. This is not just because they do not sweat out the things their skin absorbs, but they also have digestive systems that work quickly but ineffectively so they do not filter out most of the unhealthy things they eat. Pigs are known to eat feces (their own or anything else's), dead animals and trash when food is short. Anything that is in those items goes into a pig's meat. 2. Their meat is not healthy
Besides storing various unmentionables, pigs store a lot of fat in their meat. Consumption of large quantities of saturated fat over time has been linked to various lifestyle diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and osteoporosis. In addition, most of the pork provided in the United States and other large capitalist economies is processed. In order to keep up with the consumption of pork, the industry needs to raise as many pigs as possible. As I mentioned before, pigs are exposed to a lot of bacteria and disease, so they get pumped full of antibiotics to treat them as well as various drugs to make them get fatter more quickly. When eating pork, you may be getting these as well, and this is linked to resistance to superbacterias and can cause other medications you might take to be ineffective. 3. Production is bad for the environment
Factories used to produce pork products take up a lot of land that could be used for (forgive my language) organic food products. Pork could potentially be produced ethically and safely on farms where pigs can keep themselves cleaner and be treated a lot better. A whole lot of water is also used in these factories in order to process the meat. On a farm, this would instead be used for feed, water and cleaning which would drastically reduce the amount wasted on washing away the byproducts of slaughter. Speaking of byproducts, did you know that all of the pigs' feces, urine and anything else washed out of their pens is dumped in locations where it can easily be blown into or tracked onto the property of people living or working near a factory farm? Now you do. GROSS. 4. The industry is filthy
It is no secret that pigs and other farm animals forced into factory production live in cruel and unclean living conditions. Likewise, the working environment for humans is also unfair. The work, as expected, is undesirable and is therefore done mainly by undocumented workers who are paid less than minimum wage. Reasons that the work is undesirable include: working in pig feces and remains, being exposed to an element in pig brains that causes neural damage in humans and heavy-quick moving machinery. Many workers in the industry wind up with permanent disabilities and injuries. While these workers are slaving away, the big-wigs they are working for are sitting back and profiting. Most of the pork produced, in not just the U.S. but also the world, is under a few large-scale companies. This takes away from the profit of small farmers while filling everyone's bellies with meat that is less clean and healthful than the meat that comes from small-scale farms. 5. Bonus round: religion, genetics and ethics
Many cultures throughout history have disavowed pork because of its impurity. This includes various Christian religions in addition to sects of both Islamism and Judaism. Remember in high school when we dissected pigs? That is because genetically they are very similar to humans, and if that isn't enough for you, they are similar in intelligence to dogs. Pigs like to play and are known to be smarter than dogs (please don't crucify me). Ethically, eating pork is like eating one of your family. So what can we all do? As someone who eats well-balanced meals all day on some days but eats carbs all day on others, I'm not one to judge people on their dietary choices. I think that everyone has the right to eat whatever they want and it's nobody's business. I do, however, have some recommendations, at least when it comes to pork: Be informed about the source of the pork you eat and the conditions it is produced in. Limit consumption of pork to maintain a healthful diet. Try local meats and produce.

The major difference between us has to do with our diets. So, if you're like me and feel like you're on the cusp of being a top-tier athlete but couldn't quite stand with the others because of your subpar dining habits, then this article is for you. This is how you, too, can eat like an Olympian, based on your chosen sport. Christine Kim / Daily Nexus If you want to eat like ice dancer Madison Chock:
Stock up on loads of water, fruit and colorful veggies.
In an interview with Delish in January, Chock said, I try to lean towards a fish diet, and†dairy is the one thing that we've [she and her partner Evan Bates] been conscious about ¶ cutting back on†cheese, milk and†eggs.ù
However, don't feel like you have to cut out all the bad in your meal plan. Despite their pretty strict diet, Chock and Bates still make time for the occasional Taco Tuesday. If you want to eat like cross-country skier Sophie Caldwell:
Eat to replenish burned fuel. With all the activity that Caldwell does on and off the back slopes, she has to make sure she's keeping her nutrition intake up to keep her on top of her game. Unlike Madison Chock, Caldwell actually eats quite a bit of dairy, with yogurt and cheese popping up throughout the day.
I'm from Vermont, and my favorite cheese†is definitely Cabot cheddar. You can always find a big block of that in my fridge,ù Caldwell told Delish. If you want to eat like alpine skier Ted Ligety:
Don't count calories, just make sure you're getting the right nutrients.
Ligety told ABC News in January, We definitely try to eat more food than less food. I try to eat really healthy, a high-protein diet with lots of vegetables.ù
Ligety focuses on foods high in protein and carbs to keep up his energy and prepare for his rigorous workouts. So now that you know just what to eat to prepare for those games, get out there and bring home the gold!

on-the-menu,A Review of the Dining Commons' Finest,22-Feb-18,12:47 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/81184/,"After coming to college, I've fallen into the trap of the coffee-drinking world. But in the coffee world, there's so many drinks to choose from and as a newbie it's quite overwhelming. If you need the caffeine but are lost in the sea of choices, look no further because here's a guide to start you on your coffee-drinking journey. Come and join me as I set out on a task to see which coffee drink is the tastiest and most efficient at the dining commons. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Espresso
This coffee was by far the strongest of the three. Not only did this taste like that rich coffee bean smell, but it was the most efficient in getting me through the day. I found that I was more awake throughout my day compared to the other days with the cappuccino and latte, probably on account of the 64 mg of caffeine per ounce. Cappuccino
Calling all my chocolate lovers: This drink is perfect for you because it tastes very much like a chocolatey coffee. The cappuccino was more of the middle-man between the three drinks, not as strong as the espresso but not as milky as the latte. I felt the caffeine wearing off near the end of the day, but it did get me through my classes. Latte
This one was the sweetest out of the three. If you're in need of caffeine but don't love the coffee taste quite as much, this is the perfect drink for you. However, I found myself dozing off through some of my classes later in the day. After this small coffee-drinking journey, I would say the cappuccino was my favorite since it wasn't too strong but kept me going through the day. But the thing I learned and loved the most about coffee is that it's completely do-it-yourself; you can choose to add more sugar, milk, creamer, etc., to your liking. I'm no coffee expert, so go to the dining commons, whip yourself up a cup of joe and see what works best for you!

on-the-menu,Meat the Key Ingredient of Dorm Food Cooking: SPAM,23-Feb-18,12:41 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/meat-the-key-ingredient-of-dorm-food-cooking-spam/,"Cooking in college is hard, especially when you live in the dorms. The food at the dining commons can get boring after eating it every single day, but you still gotta eat something, right? For me, switching my meal plan to 10 meals per week was a really smart decision because I knew I would get tired of the dining commons food, and it gave me time to cook with my friends and experiment with sorts of creative recipes with whatever I could find at the food bank.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus One of the best ingredients to cook with is spam because it's incredibly cheap and you can incorporate it into any meal and make it taste that much better. As for the other things you'll need for cooking in the dorms, you can usually rent out pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils from the front desk. In terms of everything else, I snuck out bowls, knives and forks from DLG, but don't worry, I'll return them at the end of the year. For the ingredients other than spam, you can make trips to the food bank to get fresh produce and other goodies you can incorporate into your meals, but here's everything that I've cooked during my Fall Quarter at UCSB and let me tell you, it was not bad at all. Spam Musubi: Everybody loves spam musubi. It's simple and delicious. Aside from the spam, you'll need white rice, which can be found at the food bank, and a few sheets of seaweed. When I made spam musubi, I had to bring the seaweed from home because you most likely won't find that at the food bank. All you need to do it cook the rice in a pot according to the package directions, but if you're too lazy to cook the rice, white rice from Panda Express is always an option. Then after slicing and cooking the spam, all you need to do is pack the rice together and section it off into the size of the spam slices and wrap it in a piece of seaweed. You can also use some soy sauce packets from Panda Express to give the spam more flavor! Spam Fried Rice: For the spam fried rice, I used all the ingredients I used for the spam musubi in additional to onions I got from the food bank and lots of soy sauce packets from Panda Express. I basically diced the spam and onion, cooked the rice, and let it sit out for 15 minutes. Then, I threw all the rice, spam, and onion in a frying pan and let it cook until the spam was cooked. To top it off, I just ripped up some seaweed and sprinkled it on top as a garnish. All in all, spam is one of the best ingredients to cook with if you're looking for some creative ways to eat while living in the dorms. These meals are super simple and easy to make, and you really don't need to spend that much money if you take advantage of the resources on campus, so go ahead and try it out. You won't regret it!

This little green gem appeared earlier this month on Feb. 21, awaiting the celebration on March 17. The Shamrock Shake first hit the markets in 1970 for St Patrick's Day and it's been a crowd favorite ever since. At first, the shake was made with vanilla ice cream and lemon/lime sherbet. By 1973, it was just a vanilla shake with green coloring, but now it's mint-flavored with creamy vanilla soft serve. Who wouldn't rush to the end of the rainbow to get your hands on it? Last year, McDonald's introduced a collection of Shamrock beverages including the Shamrock Chocolate Shake, the Shamrock Chocolate Chip Frapp√©, the Shamrock Mocha and the Shamrock Hot Chocolate, which will hopefully make an appearance in 2018 as well. Regardless, the Shamrock Shake is back, so be sure to head over and grab one before they're gone! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus

on-the-menu,Too Much of a Good Thing,1-Mar-18,12:06 AM,['Calista Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/too-much-of-a-good-thing/,"Hot bean water fuels our nation. Yes, you read that right. With approximately 83 percent of adults drinking coffee in the United States, you probably know numerous people in your life who seemingly can't live without it î perhaps even yourself. † Courtesy of pixabay.com Yet what do we truly know about this beverage that controls the majority of the population, besides how many creamers you like to put in your cup o' joe or your go-to Starbucks order? While there are numerous benefits to drinking coffee, you know what they say about too much of a good thing. BENEFITS: Coffee may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. According to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), participants who increased their coffee intake to more than one cup a day had an 11 percent decrease in risk over a four-year period, in comparison to people who did not change their intake amount. Coffee may reduce suicide risk and depression in women. In another study led by HSPH, researchers found that women who drank around four cups of coffee a day had a 20 percent lower risk of depression than those who drank little to none. Coffee may increase alertness and even assist cognitive performance. In addition, numerous studies show that regular coffee drinkers have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease than those who do not drink coffee. Coffee may lower the risk of multiple sclerosis. According to a study published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, coffee can protect against neural inflammation that results in the development and recurrence of the disease. Coffee may reduce the risk of alcohol-related cirrhosis. Although you can also reduce the risk of chronic liver damage and failure by, you know, cutting back on your alcohol consumption, according to a comprehensive review done by the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, drinking two or more cups of coffee can also reduce the risk of developing this liver condition by 44 percent. RISKS: Coffee may cause insomnia and restlessness. Many people drink coffee to stay awake or alert, but drinking more than the recommended maximum of four cups of coffee a day may result in chronic sleep loss. Coffee may trigger anxiety. Caffeine, in general, decreases levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that regulates anxiety, which in turn increases levels of cortisol and epinephrine, hormones that cause stress. Coffee may also result in high blood pressure. Although the rise in blood pressure after coffee consumption is temporary, repeated increases in blood pressure combined with stress may result in an increased risk of heart disease, according to James D. Lane, professor of medical psychology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. Coffee may result in muscle tremors. As caffeine stimulates the brain, it also stimulates the central nervous system, and, as a result, affects motor activity. According to the National Institutes of Health, caffeine may result in eye spasms. The effects of muscle tremors can also be found in other areas of the body. Once your hands start shaking, you may want to think twice about drinking another cup of coffee. Coffee may result in more frequent trips to the restroom. As coffee is both a diuretic and a laxative, you may find yourself urinating and going No. 2 a lot more frequently. Thus, more coffee means more stress to your bladder and bowels. VERDICT: Although in recent studies, scientific research has revealed the positive aspects of coffee consumption, one of America's most beloved beverages will always be as controversial as it is popular. If you were hoping to find a justification for your venti vanilla latte addiction or your infatuation with white chocolate mochas, you may be disappointed. Unsurprisingly, adding calorie-loaded creams, sugars and flavoring to your coffee will most likely do your body more harm than good. Overall, a comprehensive review on coffee, published by the British Medical Journal, states that drinking three to four eight-ounce cups of black coffee results in optimal health benefits. Drink up! (Responsibly, of course.)

on-the-menu,Grilled Cheese Truck Rolls into New I.V. Residence,1-Mar-18,12:25 AM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/grilled-cheese-truck-rolls-into-new-i-v-residence/,"This Saturday, the Grilled Cheese Truck opened its first brick-and-mortar location in the streets of Isla Vista. Located on Embarcadero Del Norte where Santa Ynez Burrito once stood, the restaurant offers its cheesy, gooey concoctions to the hungry stomachs of UCSB students. Max Robbins / Daily Nexus Having tried the Grilled Cheese Truck back when it first came to campus during a food truck fair, I was excited to see what the restaurant had to offer in the form of a now-permanent location. Unable to make it out for the grand opening due to a rather unfortunate third case of the flu, I braved the light rain Monday afternoon for a taste of the classic American staple. Upon arriving, the restaurant proved inviting, the closed-off patio and outdoor heaters a welcome relief from the dreary weather. I paused to take a look around before making my way inside the brightly-lit establishment. Max Robbins / Daily Nexus I took my time to order, stopping behind a group of girls to consider the menu. Simple enough, they offered plain and simple melts,ù pre-prepared signature meltsù and a build your own meltù with the option to choose your own bread and sweet and/or savory additions, such as smoked pork or Nutella. Additionally, the menu offers the option to add macaroni and cheese, tomato soup, celery coleslaw or homemade bread and butter pickles as a side. I decided to really go for it with the buffalo chicken melt and a side order of tater tots, the sandwich consisting of spicy roasted buffalo chicken, habanero jack cheese, blue cheese and celery coleslaw. Max Robbins / Daily Nexus The dish delivered great flavor, the ingredients working well together to balance each other out. The celery coleslaw worked to both counteract the heat of the buffalo chicken while adding a nice freshness to an otherwise heavy sandwich. The tater tots proved an excellent addition, perfectly hot and crispy. I made my way through the grilled cheese in no time, my stomach content by the end. The Grilled Cheese Truck delivered in flavor, no doubt about it, but it fell a bit short in price, in my opinion. Starting at $3 for the basic American cheese melt, my meal amounted to a total of $12. While within the price range of its surrounding restaurants, it was a bit difficult for me to justify the price for a grilled cheese, even one as packed with flavor as this one. Max Robbins / Daily Nexus Regardless, it definitely seems like the Grilled Cheese Truck Stop has a real chance of making a name for itself in Isla Vista, as its weekday midnight and 2 a.m. weekend closing times cater to a typical college student's needs. Who knows, maybe it has what it takes to break the location's bad-luck streak.

Like the one last year, it was a huge success. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus I've attended night markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand, and from experience, I can say that this night market perfectly replicated those, from the crowds to the aromas of food vendors in the air. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Hosted at the Storke Plaza Courtyard, tables were arranged in a rectangle where all the food vendors and booths could set up. When the event started, there was a table outside where tickets were sold. These tickets were essentially their version of cash to use at all the booths. Each ticket was worth $1, and for every $10 worth of tickets, you were put into their raffle for prizes. Once you bought your tickets, you could proceed to taste whatever your taste buds desired. I decided to walk through the whole night market to see what all the tables were selling. There was a wide variety of food and drinks, including fish balls, Korean rice cakes, yakisoba, winter melon tea and milk tea boba. I instantly went to the curry fish ball booth, as that was my childhood favorite food. For only $3, I got five fish balls that tasted amazing. Throughout the night I also bought a bowl of yakisoba, Taiwanese sausages and some more fish balls! Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Not only did they have food, but they also had booths with your typical carnival games. Near the end of the night market, they had dance performances, which were fun to watch. Overall, it was a great experience and I would go again next year. Some advice for anyone looking forward to attending next year: Get there early!
Booths like the Taiwanese sausage were a crowd favorite, so they ran out earlier than the rest of the foods. So if you know you're going to eat a lot, plan your time wisely so you can get all your favorite foods before they're sold out. Lines are also inevitable, so be patient. For anyone looking for a fun experience with games and food, make sure to look out around late February next year because you won't want to miss this!

Probably not, but you should. Coffee isn't just a drink that allows you to speak to people in the morningù; it's now one of the most traded items on the planet and is probably the most important export for many tropical countries. Courtesy of pixabay.com Back in 1963, a group of coffee lovers came together and created the International Coffee Organization (ICO). Every few years, this group establishes a new International Coffee Agreement which aims to help control the market through rules and regulations as well as set the standard for coffee production around the world. With an industry that is worth $100 billion worldwide, the ICO plays an important role in the standardization of the market. So, how much do you contribute? With your $4 cup of coffee every morning, you may not think that you make up that much in the whole scheme of things, but, in fact, you are actually the most important contributor out there. Worldwide, consumers drink over 500 billion cups of coffee a year. Since a large portion of that money goes to large coffee corporations, which employ the smaller coffee farms, you're helping to give employment to over 25 million people. Go you! So the next time you ask for that double vanilla latte, think about the impact your consumerism is having on the worldwide economics of coffee. Facts about the coffee trade:  Key Words: Fair Trade: A certification proving the meeting of standards to seek equity in international trade of coffee. It evokes a dialogue between farmers and traders for transparency and respect to contribute to sustainable development. They focus on sustainable farming practices and prohibit child or forced labor. Direct Trade:† A trade system which cuts out the middlemen and salespeople to work directly with the growers themselves, fostering a better relationship between companies and growers. Direct trade is not under fair trade standards.

on-the-menu,3.5 Years a Vegetarian,15-Mar-18,12:19 AM,['Morgan Bakowsky'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-15/3-5-years-a-vegetarian/,"Three and a half years ago, I became a vegetarian. This was for various reasons, and for the most part it did not affect my life too drastically. Before becoming a vegetarian, I did not eat very much meat, as I was mostly eating dining commons òfood' that didn't always offer the tastiest meat options. Christine Kim / Daily Nexus Eventually, considering the fact that I am also lactose-intolerant, I decided to go for it and try to be vegan. This also was not a huge move for me because I do not like eggs and wanted to avoid desserts because, well, the Freshman 30 (yes, 30 in my case). This, too, did not limit me much, as I am pretty creative when it comes to food combos and work in a dining commons where there are plenty of options. I never tried to follow the vegan diet 100 percent because sometimes you just need a blueberry muffin. But for the most part, I have avoided animal products in most meals for the last couple of years. As I started my senior year, I realized something important: I have never had the coveted Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries, nor have I ever had a burrito from FreeBirds or tacos from literally anywhere else in the area. After being asked by a friend about my senior year bucket list, I decided that my UCSB experience would not be complete unless I had tried all of the Isla Vista favorites. This, of course, meant eating meat, so I knew that my body would have to become used to digesting animal products.  Over Valentine's weekend, I went back home to the Bay to visit my boyfriend and decided that I might as well start my transition by ordering chicken enchiladas from my favorite Mexican restaurant. On Feb. 16, 2018 at approximately 8 p.m., I ate meat for the first time in three and a half years. Everything seemed perfect: the music, the decor, the woman who always walks around trying to sell flowers in the restaurant¶. And then the moment came. I had ordered my enchiladas, sin queso por supuesto, and they were sitting there staring back at me begging to be eaten. I announced Okay, Javi, here goes nothing,ù and took my first bite. The taste was excruciatingly, inevitably, excitingly¶ nothing special. They tasted exactly how I expected; they were tasty, but honestly not much tastier than the potato enchiladas I had at Portola the same week. I gobbled them up nonetheless and pondered margarita choices. Within 30 minutes, they started fighting my stomach. I had heard before that some people have an easy transition to eating meat for the first time, but I have also heard of people who have become very sick from it.  I, unfortunately, am now one of those people. My stomach was in knots for almost 24 hours, and I was sure that I would vomit if I wasn't careful. The nausea kept me awake, and I was in and out of the restroom all of the following day. Needless to say, it was an unsuccessful mission, and I concluded that I can never eat meat again.  On the upside, I recently saw an amazing discovery on a friend's snap-story: vegan buffalo chicken fries! At this point, my attempt to eat meat may have been for nothing but an article (#doitforthedailynexus), but my Isla Vista experience still has potential to be completed.

on-the-menu,Legen-Dairy Alternatives,15-Mar-18,12:21 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-15/legen-dairy-alternatives/,"Living the non-dairy life is pretty hard, especially when you're lactose intolerant like me but just can't resist ice cream! But don't worry, there are other options out there that have the same taste but won't leave you running to the bathroom right after you drink a cup of milk. Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus Milk: A delicious drink that has many uses like being added to smoothies, poured on cereal or paired with some nice cookies. However, it has extremely negative side effects for those who can't drink it. Even though milk is rich in its calcium and protein, its alternatives provide calcium as well as vitamin D. Drinks like soy milk, almond milk, coconut milk and cashew milk are great alternatives for those who can't drink milk but can't resist it either! Yogurt: Yogurt can be a common breakfast or snack food and is sometimes even used as salad dressing. Yogurt helps those who can handle the dairy to promote a healthy gut, but for those who can't, it will do the exact opposite to your stomach. Yogurt alternatives such as coconut, almond, soy and hemp yogurt can be the healthy and satisfying taste you're looking for if you sometimes feel like you're about to cave and look up directions to the nearest Yogurtland. Ice Cream: For me, this is my greatest weakness of all, especially living at the dining commons where I have access to ice cream at lunch and dinner. However, I've learned that the happiness while eating may be amazing in the moment, but the consequences after triumph over. I found that looking at the ice cream ingredients can be very helpful because there are ice creams out there that are made with non-dairy milks such as coconut or soy milk. Another option is sorbet, which is never made with dairy. If anything, you can make your own by just blending up frozen bananas with frozen fruits of your choice. All these alternatives provide that creaminess and deliciousness of regular ice cream. Cheese: Who would've thought that you could make cheese from nuts or soy, but it's another plus for the lactose intolerant crowd. Alternatives can also be made by blending vegetable oil with pea starch or pea protein. Other things people have begun using to replicate cheese is tofu and yeast, both of which offer a good source of nutrients. It's quite easy to replicate the cheese-like texture and taste with these alternatives as well, so next time you feel the need for cheese, don't hesitate, just make sure it's dairy free. Butter: Butter is often an essential in cooking as well as baking or toast-making. But fear not, you can find so many butter alternatives now in grocery stores, most of which are made from vegetable oil blends or coconut. There are even nut and seed butters. Another option could be making your own with hundreds of recipes online that can cater to your every need, depending on how you need to use the butter. All in all, being lactose intolerant doesn't mean you're put at a disadvantage in the dairy world but actually opens up your own world to endless possibilities of trying new and friendly alternatives! So next time you think of caving to a bowl of cereal or some cheese and crackers, go ahead. Just make sure to check the ingredients. † † † Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,A Week of Being Vegan,15-Mar-18,12:39 AM,['Ingrid Lin'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-15/a-week-of-being-vegan/,"The dining commons always receive a vast mix of reviews. On one hand, I know of people who are really happy with the dining commons food and eat there day-to-day with sated appetites. On the other hand, I know of people who cannot stand the food there at all, mostly from people with specific food restrictions. My RA moved out and had to quit being an RA solely because there were not enough kosher options in the dining commons. Although I am content with dining commons food, I was curious to see how limiting the options are for students who choose to follow alternative diets, whether for health reasons or religious customs. My roommate, Ria, and I decided to go on a vegan diet for a week as an experiment. Besides our diet, the other aspects of our lifestyle stayed the same. What worried both of us about this challenge was whether we would reach our daily calorie intake, especially since we work out five days a week for an hour and a half every morning. Our regular diet prior to this experiment cut out sugary desserts and anything else we regarded as unhealthy, so our options were even more limited. As part of the diet and workout health plan that I follow, I have to eat 2,000 calories and 100 grams of protein per day. With only 10 meal swipes, I typically eat two meals on heavy workout days and one meal on light workout days. However, I still went in with an optimistic mindset and had complete faith in the dining commons. My roommate, who followed a vegetarian diet prior to the experiment, was more cynical and thought that being vegan would be extremely difficult because she already had trouble eating a full meal in the dining commons as a vegetarian.  With that in mind, we attempted to do the following for a week: Day 1: I had to shield my eyes as I was walking past the fettucine alfredo, french toast and chicken noodle soup. I went around once in the dining commons, scoping out the vegan dishes that were available to me. Out of all the chef-prepared dishes, only three were vegan; one of which was simply another pasta. The other two dishes were potato salad and shoestring fries. Technically, there were only two options because our health regimen restricted us from eating fries. The other vegan options came from the salad bar and from the group of foods that were served as meal bases such as baked potato and rice. I ended up eating the two vegan options and made myself a peanut butter jelly sandwich and ate a sad, plain ol' baked potato and a spinach salad with no dressing. In order to meet my calorie intake, I had to eat multiple servings of the same thing, which would become a common occurrence throughout the week. †† Day 2: On our second day, we decided to go to DLG. Compared to Portola, the dining commons that we ate at the day before, there were a lot more vegan options (and a lot more options in general). †My tummy was satisfied as it was filled up with three sweet potatoes î an essential food in the fitness world î some vegetable stir-fry, a Mediterranean couscous salad, a spinach salad and PB&J. Not only were there a lot of options, but the quality of each dish was also top-notch. The sweet potatoes were ripe and had a sheen of natural caramelization on top, and the Mediterranean salad was light and refreshing, but still flavorful. † Day 3:  Portola again. Because I had a heavy workout day today, I had both lunch and dinner instead of just one or the other. Although there was a variety of vegan dishes for both lunch and dinner, †I noticed that most of the dishes served just involved some steamed vegetables with different seasoning. There was braised bok choy, carrots with thyme and daikon rolls. It is true that vegetables do make up the majority of the vegan diet, but I think the vegan options available reveal the common misconception that followers of a vegan diet just eat salad and other plants. Many of the actual prepared dishes could have easily been made into vegan versions such as the fettucini alfredo, which could have substituted the heavy cream for soy milk or soy cream cheese. I began to understand the frustration for a lot of vegans who have to clear up what a strict vegan diet actually is.  Day 4:  On Thursdays, Ria and I have yoga class in the evening, so we ate dinner at Ortega beforehand. This was probably the worst day out of the entire week. On the online menu, we read that there were vegan options for pasta. However, it turned out that only the noodles themselves were vegan. Both of the separate sauces contained meat or milk ingredients. Disappointed, Ria and I ended up trying to season the noodles by adding some olive oil, salt and pepper, which we later found out was the most unappetizing combination. While walking around the dining commons and surveying our vegan options, we discovered that NONE of the prepared dishes were vegan. Even the relatively unhealthy options and the dessert that we decided to eat as a last resort were not vegan either. All that was vegan was, again, the salad bar, the PB&J station and some whole wheat tortillas. The whole wheat wrap that I made with some cilantro, tomatoes, brown rice, lime and a LOT of Cholula hot sauce tasted pretty good, but it was not enough to fill me up. I made myself a PB&J and a salad to suppress my hunger. Although I was full, by then I was getting pretty sick of the same PB&J and spinach salad that I ate every meal. I was only on day four. I could not imagine what it would be like to maintain a diet with dietary restrictions for longer terms.  Day 5: By then, I was really sick of eating PB&J and spinach salad, so I decided not to eat it . Instead I ate three baked potatoes and a bowl of hearty vegetable soup, and out of all the days, this was when I felt completely done with this experiment. Because I was discouraged from the meal I had the night before, paired with the subpar dining menu today, I only ate enough to where I was not full but also not hungry anymore. It was also the first day where I ate below my 2,000 calorie count. I only ate 1,400 calories and drank an additional vegan protein shake and some vegan protein bars to make up for the missing calories.  Day 6: Saturday! Which means brunch! Personally, I think brunch is the best meal of the week. There were a lot of options, and I was full from all the fruit that I ate, which comprised of honeydew, cantaloupe, watermelon and grapefruit. I also ate heaps of diced russet potatoes, a warm flour tortilla and oatmeal with berries and brown sugar. I did not really keep track of the stuff I ate because I was so hungry. Brunch was excellent. †† Day 7:  This was the last day. Although I was definitely healthier these past seven days, I was glad that this was the last day before I reverted back to my old diet. This was definitely harder than I originally expected, but I was glad that I followed through with it, even though there were times when I was tempted to eat a parfait or some tri-tip steak. Of course, I ate a salad and a PB&J (which I will not be eating anymore for a long time after this), a vegetable sushi roll and a New York Style Crumb Cake, which was a literal bittersweet way to celebrate the ending of my week-long journey. † Takeaway All in all, this experience was eye-opening. It was hard having to maintain such a strict diet given the limited options. I do believe that one of the reasons why I felt that the options were limiting was because I needed to eat a lot of food per day due to my health regimen. People who are trying to follow the same diet but have smaller appetites or do not need to eat that much food may believe that the options are enough. Some college students already stress out about eating three meals a day; imagine them having to stress out about what they can and cannot eat even with all the prepared food. I think it is worth trying to diversify the options for different diets to ensure that each student gets the nourishment he or she needs. A solution would be to make some of the smaller dining commons cater towards people with special dietary needs, while the bigger dining commons such as DLG or Portola serve broader diets.

on-the-menu,Eat Nothing White Diet,19-Mar-18,12:33 AM,['Taylor Glastetter'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-19/eat-nothing-white-diet/,"Dieting. It's a classic story for the ages that has seen so many myths, harsh realities and confusing quests to achieve one's desired result. But with so many voices talking about the subject, it can be hard to distinguish what actually works and what is just a waste of your time. Of course, I could tell you that the key to leading a healthier lifestyle is to get off your butt and work out more and combine that with foods that are healthierù; sadly, no, that doesn't include the maple bar from Krispy Kreme that you had this morning. But what's the fun in that? You've already heard that advice a million times, so this time I'm going to give you an opportunity to explore yet another diet and decide for yourself if the results (and sacrifices) are worth it. Introducing the Eat Nothing Whiteù diet: Courtesy of commons.wikimedia.org What is it?  The Eat Nothing Whiteù diet, also called No White at Nightù diet, is based upon the principle of losing weight by cutting out whiteù foods, which contain high concentrations of simple carbohydrates that can lead to drastic weight gain. Proponents of the diet praise its ability to reduce blood sugar (helping to keep weight in check), but often cite its difficulty to maintain long term. The diet calls for you to cut out white foods, including white potatoes, rice, flour, beans, sugar and products made with these, like bread or pasta. Additionally, dieters are urged to cut out products that would be white without artificial coloring added, like butter and cheddar cheese. Of course, like any diet there are exceptions to the white cut-outs. Exceptions are cauliflower, white fish and poultry meat. What can you eat? The diet seems simple to follow as all you have to do is make sure you're cutting out the badù foods and sticking to the good. This diet is a good one to combine with other, healthier meal plans. For example, while cutting out the white foods, make sure that what you are eating is still beneficial for you. A sample menu includes lots of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, poultry/fish, nuts and brown rice or beans. Pros/Cons Unfortunately on trend with a lot of other fad diets, this one has a list of disadvantages. It has a high history of being too difficult to stick with, as cutting out all white foods is difficult. Additionally, many have seen that once they introduce these foods back into their diet, they also say hello to the weight they dropped. But on the bright side, the success of this diet truly does depend on you and how far you decide to take it. The disadvantages only lie in one's inability to stick with it, which means there aren't any significant health risks (which is common with other fad diets) and you remain in control of the results. The Verdict
Personally, I think it's a bit difficult to completely cut anything out of your normal routine, let alone foods that are often considered staple items. However, this diet does seem like, if done properly, you'll see results. My advice, take it in moderation. Cut out some of the white foods you typically eat, like flour and sugar, and keep everything else in check. Exercise more than you probably want to, and add some other colors through fresh fruits and veggies. Also, if you try this, let me know how it goes!

I believe in mixing it up!!! I am trying to put on weight. What should I do? To put on weight, eat high-protein, high-calorie foods (red meat, milk shakes made with premium ice cream, beans with salt-pork, ¶) and do weight-lifting exercises to build muscle mass. this is a wise way to avoid eating unhealthy food. White sugar, white rice, flour (white),potato(white), white bread¶ very easy to remember the rule. Cool! Reminding myself to eat the nature colorful food, such as five different colors vegetables. And meat, we choose white, chicken and fish Carbohydrates cause heart disease, obesity, cancer and diabetes. I began the nothing whiteù dietary program @ Christmas, and incorporated a daily regimen of walking for an hour 4-5 times a week.  Have had no problems sticking to the plan ì my cravings for large meals and portions has diminished.  Results ì loss of 35 lbs thus far.  My plan ì make it a life-time eating and exercise plan.  Biggest surprise has been the reduction/elimination of a variety of nagging ailments. You have achieved my goals! I like knowing it is realistic to strive for a better quality of life. My trainer says you should adhere strictly to the regimen for six days and on the seventh, take a moderate break. In this way, you can still enjoy your favorite whiteù foods one day a week. Nice

Some of its most popular pastries include the famous 85∞C egg tarts, cheese dogs, matcha red bean rolls and pork sung buns. Since 2003, 85∞C Bakery Cafe has expanded from Taiwan to China, Hong Kong, Australia and the U.S. with over 1,000 locations worldwide. Known as the Starbucks of Taiwan,ù the bakery cafe chain rose in popularity because of their famous sea salt coffee, a caff√® americano topped with a frothy sea salt cream at the top. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Over the weekend, I took a trip down to the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles, where you can find Asian food on almost every street you drive down. Since there aren't really any amazing Asian food options near UCSB, I always make it my mission to buy and devour all the Asian food that I have back home when I visit L.A. One of my go-to spots for pastries and tea is 85∞C Bakery Cafe because of their delicious pastries that I can bring back to school to snack on during study breaks and their amazing sea salt beverages that I literally crave everyday.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus When you enter the bakery, there's a whole section of self-serve shelves with an endless variety of different breads, cakes, and other pastries to choose from. Here are some of my favorites: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus After choosing your pastries, you pay at the cash register where they individually wrap your bread and you can also purchase drink orders at that time. The Sea Salt Coffee is very popular, and they even have special promotions where they're only $0.85 on Mondays. My personal favorite is the Sea Salt Mountain Top Green Tea. The sea salt really brings out the sweetness of the tea and it's always fun to swirl your drink and see the sea salt foam mix with the green tea. Another drink I like is the Iced Matcha Latte made with whole milk and matcha powder. The sweetness level is just right so that you can really taste the matcha flavor. Aside from these beverages, customers can also choose from different coffees, milk teas and even slushes. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus 85∞C Bakery Cafe is the perfect place to grab a drink and munch on yummy pastries. Everything is so cute and delicious that you'll want to try it all! They come out with so many new and creative breads, cakes and drinks that really set them apart from other bakeries. So the next time you stop by the L.A. area, be sure to grab some bread and boba, or if you're like me, stock up with an entire box of pastries to bring back to Santa Barbara. What's the point of posting about something that's not in SB County? There are many big chain establishments that SB doesn't have, so I suggest writing articles that are about *local* places that would help students and even local businesses come together. I agree with this Yeah but the point of this article is that there's no good Asian food places in SB so this place in LA is dank It says its under the on the road section so it doesn't have to be in the SB County just anywhere on the road Great article Winnie! You're descriptions are making me really hungry for some Asian bakery right now. I'll be going to 85 degrees as soon as I make my way to L.A!

on-the-menu,I Scream! You Scream! We All Scream For Choppa Ice Cream!,5-Apr-18,12:00 AM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/i-scream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for-choppa-ice-cream/,"Choppa Ice Cream opened its doors in Goleta this past weekend. Welcoming residents with a buy-one-get-one-half-off deal for its soft opening, the shop is located in Hollister Village by Pickles and Swiss. Serving up Thai rolled ice cream, Choppa is setting itself apart from the typical run-of-the-mill soft serve and frozen yogurt. Irene Wang / Daily Nexus The location is great, allowing natural sunlight in through the windows and beckoning customers to come satisfy their sweet tooth. Decorated with mounted neon signs throughout and largely painted wings on one wall, the shop is the perfect backdrop for any Instagram photo. Choppa Ice Cream offers 10 different flavors of ice cream: taro bby,ù matcha-cha,ù take me 2 paradise,ù dark matter,ù for the 'gram,ù milk buddy,ù monkey business,ù tarty party,ù mangoes & cr√®meù and vanilla-killa.ù The ice cream comes out to $6.99 plus tax, giving customers the option to choose a total of up to three toppings. Switched out daily, toppings can include anything from sprinkles and chocolate chips to gummy bears and Pocky. Irene Wang / Daily Nexus Rolled ice cream is exactly what it sounds like and twice as delicious. The employee pours a milk-based liquid onto a large steel plate that is set to below freezing temperatures. Toppings are then added and quickly chopped up into the mixture using metal spatulas. Once frozen, the mixture is thinly spread out on the surface of the metal plate and the metal spatula is pushed across to roll up thin strips. The treat originated through street vendors in Thailand before becoming popular and eventually making its way to the U.S. I fully indulged in all that Choppa Ice Cream had to offer, opting for the milk buddyù Oreo ice cream and topping it with chocolate chips, sprinkles and M&Ms. The dish lived up to every one of my expectations, perfectly creamy and somehow holding up under the surprising midday sun. Despite the overwhelming number of sweet ingredients, and my typically salty palette, I loved the ice cream. There's no doubt in my mind that I will be back; within an hour of returning I had recommended Choppa Ice Cream to my housemate. Irene Wang / Daily Nexus Choppa Ice Cream already holds a place in my heart, and I'm sure the same will soon be true for others. With temperatures set to rise in the coming week, Choppa is sure to be brimming with customers longing for a sweet treat.

Maybe today you'll order something other than the usual vanilla latte to get your morning started. But one look at the complicated menu covered with words like half city roastù and continental roastù overwhelms you to the max. Trust me, I've been there. Choosing between all these roasts of coffee can be kind of intimidating, and it probably seems unnecessary if you're just looking for something to keep you awake through lecture. But if you are looking to try something new, here's a simple guide on the different types of coffee roasts you need to know to expand your horizon of coffee knowledge! Courtesy of commons.wikimedia.org Before we dive in, let's talk about the roasting process itself and why it's important. Coffee beans are normally in a green state, and roasting them brings out the coffee aroma and taste in the bean. Roasting is a process in which coffee beans are rapidly brought to very high temperatures that causes the oil and moisture from the coffee bean to come out, then the process is stopped abruptly when the beans are quickly cooled, resulting in a crunchy texture that is ready to be brewed. The coffee roasting process can take as little as half a minute to as long as half an hour, depending on the roast. The temperature at which the beans are roasted at also vary from 350∞F to 485∞F, depending on the level of roast. This process is extremely important to get a diverse range of different caffeine levels and flavors in each batch of coffee beans, which make up all the different choices of coffee we have today. LIGHT ROAST LIGHT CITY ROAST ¢ HALF CITY ROAST ¢ CINNAMON ROAST Light roast coffee is light brown in color and is generally associated with milder coffee beverages. Contrary to popular belief, light roasts actually have a slightly higher caffeine level than dark roasts! They are roasted at a lower temperature (350∞F ì 400∞F) compared to the rest, resulting in high acidity levels, which give it an earthy flavor. MEDIUM ROAST CITY ROAST ¢ AMERICAN ROAST ¢ BREAKFAST ROAST Medium roasts are stronger and browner in color than light roasts because they are roasted in slightly higher temperatures (410∞F ì 430∞F). Since the acidity levels are lower, it brings out the bitterness in the coffee bean and allows for a more balanced flavor. MEDIUM-DARK ROAST FULL CITY ROAST ¢ DINNER ROAST ¢ VIENNA ROAST These roasts are roasted in a higher temperature (about 435∞F ì 445∞F), bringing the oil to the surface of the beans. The beans are a dark brown color and the flavor is bittersweet. Medium-dark roasts have virtually no acidity to them. DARK ROAST FRENCH ROAST ¢ CONTINENTAL ROAST ¢ SPANISH ROAST Dark roasts roasted in the highest temperatures (465∞F ì 485∞F) have a shiny surface because of all the oil and have the darkest brown color. They also contain the lowest amount of caffeine and taste the most smoky and bitter. Whether you're just starting to drink coffee or just looking to add something new to your morning routine, it's important to know what type of coffee you're drinking because caffeine levels and coffee flavors depend on which type of coffee roasts you're buying. There are many other factors that contribute to how it tastes, like the origins of the coffee beans, the processing method and the brewing method, but it's definitely good to know some basic information about coffee roasts to better plan your day. It's suggested to start your morning off with a lighter roast, drink a medium roast during lunchtime and end your day with a dark roast paired with dinner. So now that you have this knowledge, be sure to get the full coffee experience, and maybe you'll appreciate coffee as something more than just a means to get through the day.

From Thai rolled ice cream to visually stunning ice cream like fish-shaped ice cream cones and cotton candy clouds. It doesn't seem to just stop there: unusual ice cream flavors like activated charcoal ice cream in charcoal cones are making their appearance. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus This past weekend I visited Koreatown, Los Angeles, where you can find the best of the best †of Korean food and at amazing prices. Every time I take a trip to Koreatown I'm always finding unique restaurants or dessert places. This time I visited Drips & Swirls, a soft serve and coffee shop that originated the whole charcoal soft serve. Drips & Swirls first opened to the general public on Aug. 25, 2016, started by four owners. The most notable owner is David So, a Korean-American YouTuber/musical artist with about 1.5 million subscribers. The owners created a shop where their soft serves are made from scratch, 100 percent real milk with no fillers, powders or gimmicks and they strive for detail and care in every treat or drink. All their flavors are created and inspired by their Korean-American backgrounds. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus When you first drive up to the shop, you might be surprised with how small it is, but as the saying goes, things come in small packages. The front of the shop has the menu of all their frozen treats and drinks and small windows for you to order and pickup. For their soft-serve flavors, they always have three of the same ones (charcoal crispy rice, melon bar and Captain Crunch) and a seasonal one, which at time of my visit was pistachio honey. Of course I had to get the charcoal flavored ice cream to see what the hype was all about, and my friend got the Captain Crunch to share. Their teas also sounded very interesting, so I ordered their Green Apple-White Tea draft tea. The soft serves were amazing and lived up to their shop's motto, All Flavor, No Gimmicks.ùBoth of the soft serves were so creamy, you could taste the richness in them. The charcoal taste was an unusual but familiar flavor. As for the tea, the natural bitterness of it enhanced the tart and sweet apple flavor. They also had a small seating area that was nicely decorated and provided a cozy, cute place for their customers to enjoy their treats. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus The soft serves and drinks at Drips & Swirls are one of a kind. I would go again to explore more of their menu and would highly recommend it to anyone who's in the area or just wants to enjoy tasty desserts at a reasonable price.

Try McCaf√©'s Iced Turtle Macchiato,12-Apr-18,12:11 AM,['Ingrid Lin'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/need-some-espresso-for-your-depresso-try-mccafes-iced-turtle-macchiato/,"Recently, McDonald's introduced the limited edition Iced Turtle Macchiato to its extensive McCaf√© menu. Online, it is described to be a cool, creamy medley of chocolate and caramel flavors.ù Although the chocolate and caramel are the most prominent notes of the drink, a variety of other ingredients enhance its supposed unique taste. In addition to the caramel and chocolate syrup, the sweet beverage also combines hazelnut flavors with the preferred choice of whole, low-fat or nonfat milk with a shot of dark roasted espresso. Intrigued, I ordered this drink and customized it by asking for a topping of whipped cream and an extra shot of espresso. Ingrid Lin / Daily Nexus The presentation of the drink itself was very appealing. The smooth chocolate syrup dripped along the interior of the cup, creating a marbleized pattern as it swirled with the golden caramel. The drink produced a natural gradient of brown that became richer as the chocolate settled towards the bottom. The taste, unfortunately, was subpar. Even after stirring the drink to mix the chocolate and caramel, my taste buds were overwhelmed by the hit of sweetness. Because the sweetness was not at all subtle, the drink tasted very artificial as even the smallest hint of bitterness from the actual coffee was overpowered. It did also have a slight nutty and aromatic flavor as promised from the hazelnut, but it was juxtaposed with an odd sourness; I didn't know if it had originated from the syrups, the coffee itself or something else. Overall, the taste wasn't to my liking. However, the cheap base price of $2 for the small size compensated for the lacking quality of the taste. It is a cheaper option compared to higher-end coffee chains such as Starbucks or The Coffee Bean and & Tea Leaf. Even though I personally didn't enjoy it, I would still recommend trying it at least once given its affordability, especially for people who have a sweet tooth and prefer sugary drinks. Rating: 3/5

Some need it as a little pick-me-up after a long day, while others cannot function until they've had their first cup. If you're a regular coffee drinker, you probably also know that the different types of coffee drinkers go much deeper than simply coffee drinkerù or non-coffee drinker.ù Courtesy of flickr.com Your Average Joe: You enjoy the simple things in life: All you need is a cup of joe, some creamer and sugar. You probably own your own coffee maker or Keurig, occasionally treating yourself to a latte from Caj√© or Coffee Collab. Once you have your cup or two in the morning, then you're ready to conquer the day. Sugar Fanatic: You like to drink coffee.ù Your drink is definitely 95 percent sugar and creamer with a splash of coffee. You use Frappuccinos as an excuse to have a milkshake for breakfast and drink your dessert in the forms of pumpkin spice lattes and white chocolate mochas. The Starbucks opening in the UCen has only enabled your access to your favorite coffee concoctions in between classes with the new Hazelnut Mocha Coconut Milk Macchiato and Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato just in time for spring. Just Blackù: You view coffee as the equivalent of fuel, and you're immediately drawn to the nearest source. Caffeine is caffeine and you don't discriminate between 7/11 or the Arbor or Starbucks, sometimes even throwing in the occasional Yerba Mate when the going gets tough. You probably find yourself with a packed schedule or frequently having night shifts or pulling all-nighters. Perhaps, you even enjoy the bitter taste of hot bean water. My question for you is: Why? How? Coffee Connoisseur: You swear on the superiority of the French press over the drip coffeemaker. You probably order premium roasts from Jamaica and are intrigued by the Kopi Luwak coffee, made from coffee beans digested by the Indonesian civet cat. Yes, cat-poop coffee exists. You would never be caught dead consuming coffee from a 7/11 and frown upon those basicù Starbucks lovers. You've most likely been considering buying an espresso machine for quite some time now. Half and Half: You equally enjoy both coffee and tea and are unable to commit to the titles of a coffee personù or a tea drinker.ù Your favorite drink is probably a dirty chai tea latte in order to have the best of both worlds. You may find yourself in more than one category, and that's okay! We are all united by our love for the coffee bean, regardless of the different shapes and forms it may come in.

on-the-menu,Feeling a Little Chill: Spice Up Your Life with the Scoville Scale,12-Apr-18,12:21 AM,['Morgan Bakowsky'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/feeling-a-little-chill-spice-up-your-life-with-the-scoville-scale/,"Everyone has their favorite type of flavor. Whether it's sweet, savory, sour etc. One of mine is SPICY. In fact, my food motto is, If it isn't spicy, it isn't food.ù While many people enjoy spicy food, everyone has a limit to how much heat they can take. I wanted to find out just how much I could take and quantify that by using the scoville scale. The scoville scale is used to measure the òhotness' of various peppers in units of scoville heat units (SHU). I took to the grocery store to find the hottest peppers I could so I could taste them to see where my taste buds fall on the scale. Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus I wanted to go with only the hottest chillies but, unfortunately, most of the 10 hottest chillies in the world were all impossible to find around UC Santa Barbara. So, I picked a piece of every pepper I possibly could and here are the ones I found as ranked by the scoville scale: Bell Pepper (0-25 SHU)
Banana Pepper (0-500 SHU)
Jalape√±o Pepper (3,500-8,000 SHU)
Cayenne Pepper (30,000-50,000 SHU)
Habanero (100,000-350,000 SHU) Bell
This pepper is in EVERYTHING so I imagine that many people know that these are not hot at all. I picked red ones for no reason in particular and sliced them to use with hummus later. I did not find these hot at all but I still enjoyed them. Fun fact: Bell peppers are native to the Americas and come in many colors, including a few shades of purple! Banana
These are the La Croix of chillies; it's as if they whisper spicyù at you when you eat them. Don't get me wrong, they are tasty, but honestly not very spicy. While they do not taste like bananas, they sure look like them. Fun fact: Banana chillies are used on pizza at Blaze and in the condiment tables at various Mexican restaurants in the area! Jalape√±o
One of the more infamous chillies, the jalape√±o was the first to make my mouth sting, but not very much. I eat a lot of foods that include jalape√±os, pico de gallo por ejemplo. I would recommend this chili to people who like their food to have a slight kick. Fun fact: the jalape√±o has many names such as huachinango, chile gordo or cuaresme√±o. Its most common name, however, stems from the Nahuatl name xalapa. Cayenne
Okay, this one was pretty hot but still bearable for me. It took a couple glasses of almond milk to soothe my mouth and I was sweating but at least I was not crying. Fun fact: Cayenne peppers are part of the nightshade family of plants along with eggplant and tobacco. Habanero
Finally, my favorite chilli! This one was of course the hottest of the five and the tastiest. I was sweating, but once again it was still not the spiciest thing I have ever tasted. Fun fact: The habanero chilli was domesticated by the indigenous people who lived in the Amazon at least 8,500 years ago! In the end, I remained unimpressed because I did not find anything that made me cry and squirm in my seat like the overly spicy Thai food I had a few months ago. While I did not find the limit to how much heat I can take, I did enjoy eating chillies and learning a lot of fun facts about chillies along the way.

While this weather calls for afternoon trips to the beach and acai bowls on the lawn, it also means you'll be sweating through your top before you've even entered the second hour of your day. If you're going to make it through the remaining seven weeks of this quarter, you're going to need to consider something other than your usual ice cream cone after dinner at the dining commons. Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus Mint Mint is known to have a naturally prolonged cooling effect. The sensation is familiar from chewing gum and hard candies. Adding a few mint leaves to your water or lemonade will prove refreshing. Fruit Fruits rich in water regulate your body temperature and keep you hydrated during those blistering hot days. These include cucumber and watermelon, to name a few. Coconut water is a popular choice, as the electrolytes in it replenish ions lost in sweat. Citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges are particularly cooling and help to cleanse the body of toxins. Lemon water is a good alternative to plain water and is often offered more frequently at restaurants, as the lemon helps to rehydrate the body by balancing pH levels. Hot and Spicy Contrary to popular belief, hot foods should be an essential part of any summer diet. This doesn't just refer to foods hot in temperature, but to those packed with spice. Countries with warm and tropical climates are known to turn to steaming hot drinks or spicy soups to cool down. Doing so allows for the body to be alerted to changes in internal temperature and cool itself down, albeit with a bit of sweat. (Does your mom forcing you to drink tea when you have a fever make sense now?) Avoid Alcohol and Caffeine Both coffee and alcohol are diuretics, removing water from the body and increasing urine production. The two cause you to dehydrate much faster when consumed in large quantities. Needless to say, despite how appealing a cold drink of either may look during the summer, it is best to stay away from those during a heat wave.

The first cupcake bakery, Sprinkles opened in Beverly Hills in 2005 and proved to be an overnight sensation. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Nelson was inspired by her great grandmother, who was renowned for the distinctive desserts she served at her San Francisco bakery in the 1930s, even considering Sprinkles to be an extension of her legacy. Since its opening, Sprinkles has expanded to 22 locations across nine different states, with plans to bring 34 bakeries to the Middle East. Sprinkles Cupcakes also boasts a traveling Sprinklesmobile and the first cupcake ATM, offering the same freshly handcrafted treats such as their recently launched ice cream that customers can enjoy in store. During a visit home this weekend, I took a trip to Downtown L.A.'s open-air mall FIGat7th with my mom. Intending to spend the afternoon working on the ridiculous amount of assignments I had for the week, I stopped at Sprinkles Cupcakes to grab myself a little pick-me-up. Sprinkles Cupcakes is a familiar favorite in my house, surprisingly first introduced to us by way of their pet-friendly pupcakes. Their cupcakes are always perfectly fluffy and sweet, handcrafted and baked fresh daily. Available in both mini and regular sizes, the flavors are rotated weekly to allow customers to try some of their more seasonal favorites. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Of course flavors such as vanilla, milk or dark chocolate and strawberry are offered daily, alongside their pupcakes and red velvet. Their red velvet is available in a gluten-free, sugar-free and vegan option. Other flavors offered include: Not to mention their lemon meringue cupcake, which is being offered from April 16 to 29. Some of my favorites include their cinnamon sugar and milk chocolate cupcakes, but under the guise of being somewhat healthy and sharing, I opted for their mini sampler. The sampler, offered at five dollars, includes mini versions of their red velvet, vanilla and dark chocolate cupcakes. The three are topped with their trademark dot, star and heart, respectively. Slightly more dense than their regular cupcakes, the three were nonetheless enjoyable, the dark chocolate the clear winner in our eyes and stomachs. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Sprinkles Cupcakes is popular for good reason, their array of flavors marking them as not only the first of its kind, but the best to boot. The next time you stop by L.A., or any one of the twenty other locations, be sure to pop into their shops for a sweet treat. Maybe even design your own or take an assorted box of a dozen cupcakes to go.

The bistro is located right by the Santa Barbara Zoo next to the bird refuge and has been serving their French country bistro cuisine for almost 20 years. I discovered this little gem when my boyfriend took me here for our anniversary, and I was beyond impressed. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Our reservation was at 8 p.m., and when we got there, I immediately noticed all the strings of lights that encompassed the building and made it stand out. Once we were seated, we were surrounded by live jazz music, which is something Stella Mare's has every Wednesday from 7 to 11 p.m. The seating area was pretty small, but it was nice because it gave the restaurant a cozy and intimate mood. Their menu focuses on French cuisine and the price range was around $10-$40. To start off, we ordered the oeufs mimosa au homard, which came with three deviled eggs filled with lobster tail slices, tobiko caviar, pickled shallots and dill served on a toasted French baguette and arugula with a drizzle of olive oil. Although the eggs were small, they definitely made up for it with their flavor. The different textures and flavors of all the ingredients together provided an amazing contrast. The caviar and shallots stood out to me the most because it was so different from the creamy filling of the deviled eggs. These deviled eggs were packed with flavor and simply an amazing way to set to the mood for the rest of my experience at Stella Mare's. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus For my entree, I ordered the pan-seared Atlantic salmon from the specialty menu. The chef prepared a perfectly seared piece of salmon surround by black truffle froth, peas, edamame and sprouts. This is the best piece of salmon I have ever had. It was a little crispy on the outside and very juicy and flavorful on the inside. The truffle froth was a perfect combination with the salmon and made the meal savory yet light at the same time. The vegetables that came with the dish were also very tasty. Overall, this salmon dish was delicious, and I really liked how it wasn't too heavy. My boyfriend ordered the coq au vin, which is a French braise of chicken with red wine, lardons, pearl onions, bacon, mushrooms, green peas, garlic, carrots and mashed potatoes. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus According to my boyfriend, it tasted a bit sweet and had a [homey] flavor to it, especially with the mashed potatoes and sauce.ù I tried some of his chicken and it was extremely tender and sweet, but I definitely think my salmon was better. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus After finishing our entrees, we both still had room for dessert, so we decided to order the classic vanilla bean cr√®me br√ªl√©e. The top was perfectly caramelized and the inside had a terrific vanilla flavor and a pudding-like texture. The thing that actually surprised me the most about the dessert was the dollop of whipped cream it came with. It tasted like it was actually freshly whipped right there at the restaurant. It wasn't too sweet, so it was the perfect pairing with the sweet cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Overall, this was one of the best restaurants I've eaten at since I came to UCSB. Everything I had at Stella Mare's was delicious, and I could tell that the ingredients were very fresh, which made all the dishes so flavorful. Although it was pricey, the quality of the food and the ambiance of the entire restaurant made it worth it, and I would definitely come back here for a special occasion.

Here's the solution: black coffee (with no sugar, cream or add-ins). Ever heard of the rumors that drinking black coffee can actually be beneficial? Well, surprise! It's totally true and here are the reasons why you should be drinking it every day. Courtesy of pexels.com It's good for your liver
Your liver actually likes black coffee. Coffee helps lower the harmful liver enzymes in your blood. This helps prevent things like liver cancer or fatty liver disease 80 percent more than people who don't drink coffee on a regular basis, according to Mayo Clinic. Not only can you enjoy a nice cup of joe in the morning, but you'll also be protecting one of your most vital organs. Packed with nutrients
Drinking coffee can be your largest source of antioxidants. Black coffee contains Vitamin B2, B3, B5, manganese, potassium and magnesium. Not only is coffee packed with tons of nutrients, but also your body absorbs these nutrients better than other sources of antioxidants like fruits or vegetables. Reduces risk of disease
Black coffee also lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and heart disease. Studies published by Diabetologia and Mayo Clinic have shown that people who do drink coffee have a 30 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, a 30-60 percent lower risk of Parkinson's and 20 percent less chance for heart disease. Fights against cancer and depression
You're less likely to develop conditions like liver cancer, colorectal cancer and even depression. An ingredient in coffee helps prevent breast cancer, colon cancer and rectal cancer by helping fight against the development of tumors. Cleans your system
Coffee is a diuretic beverage meaning it will make you urinate often. Because you are constantly urinating, this flushes out all the toxins and bacteria that would have eventually been flushed out, simply enhancing this process. This helps clean and regulate for a healthy stomach. Boosts your metabolism
According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information your metabolism can be boosted by 30 percent. Caffeine is found in multiple sources of fat burning or weight loss supplements. It especially targets the belly fat and fat cells that are reused as energy. Not only is it boosting your metabolism but it can also help with weight loss. Makes you smarter
Black coffee has the ability to improve cognitive functioning, energy and mood that can all go toward helping you retain information better or help you throughout the day. Reduces stress
Having a cup of coffee can help ease pressure and tension. Coffee stimulates the central nervous system that ends up boosting your mood. Makes you happy
Last, but not least, it makes you a happier, healthier person. With all these benefits, it's hard to resist drinking coffee everyday, but at least now you know you don't have to!

Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus The event sprawled across 34 acres of property to accommodate for the hordes of guests. Arriving at the fair Saturday night, we were immediately greeted by the sight of a UFO, or rather the cutout of one acting as the roof of the ticket booth. This, of course, was our first stop, as an $8 ticket was required to enter. Making our way inside, we were immediately greeted by lights, the Ferris Wheel visible before we had even exited the freeway. There were rides beyond where the eye could see and the smell of hot dogs and popcorn carried over to us. Booths were set up all around, offering face painting and selling items such as homemade jewelry and dreamcatchers. There were caricatures being readily drawn and light up wands available for younger guests to make their way through the night. Bypassing everything for the time being, we approached the ticket booth to purchase ride tickets. Tickets were offered for $1 each and were then electronically loaded onto game cards. Wristbands covering unlimited rides were available for $28 each. The group of us opted for 10 tickets each, allowing us to enjoy roughly two rides. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus My friends were captivated by all the rides available to choose from, like the Giant Spinning Coaster and Crazy Train just to name a few. I was noticeably less eager, even skipping out when the majority of the group rode their first ride (a smart decision considering the ride temporarily broke down before starting back up again). I was, however, convinced to ride the Music Express, laughing and screaming partially out of fear the entire way. I was pushed into my partner's side the entire time we spun around, and the poor choice in song didn't exactly improve my experience. The only other ride I got on was the ferris wheel, another not-so-good choice considering I am partially scared of heights and our hands kept slipping on the pole placed in the middle. Romantic ferris wheel rides are definitely only true in movies because there's nothing romantic about almost falling out of your seat and plummeting to the ground below. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus But of course, anyone will tell you that the real allure of a fair comes from its food. Following the smell of food we had initially been bombarded with, we reached the various food vendors spread out along one area of the grounds. A look around revealed tortas, corn dogs, popcorn, curly fries, pizza, caramel apples, churros, snow cones, hamburgers and deep fried desserts to name a few. The group of us split up, everyone seeking out something different with the intention of sharing. Letting my cravings be my guide, I bypassed everything for a bacon-wrapped hot dog bigger than my head. No joke, this thing was huge and hot off the grill. It was definitely too much for a single person, my friend stealing bites every now and then. And while not the greatest hot dog I had ever tasted, it was definitely delicious. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Aside from the hot dog, we had also ordered curly fries that came in the form of a humongous mound. Appetizing in theory, the fries were beyond cold and, unfortunately, the entire bottom layer appeared to still be frozen. But of course I couldn't leave without trying some deep fried Oreos. I had been wanting to try this since last summer's Orange County Fair but had never been able to go, and these did not disappoint. Deep fried and topped with powdered sugar, whipped cream and chocolate syrup, it was a nearly overwhelmingly sweet bite but somehow managed not to cross the line. They lived up to every one of my expectations and perfectly finished up my night. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus The fair was an enjoyable experience, and even helped me face a few of my fears. I would recommend individuals young and old alike to purchase tickets for next year and take part in the fun.

on-the-menu,Pressed Juicery: Santa Barbara's Main Squeeze,10-May-18,12:04 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/pressed-juicery-santa-barbaras-main-squeeze/,"Quench your thirst the healthy way with Pressed Juicery. Located in Paseo Nuevo in downtown Santa Barbara, Pressed Juicery specializes in cold-pressed juice and juice cleanses. The company started in 2010 in a little storefront in L.A. when three friends were inspired to create juices that were both delicious and healthy. Eight years later, they've developed nine different lines of juices that are featured in more than 60 of their locations, as well as on their website. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Their different juices include greens, roots, citrus, fruits, signature blends, refreshers, coffees, premium waters and shots. I tried one of their signature blends, Vanilla Almond. On the Pressed Juicery website, it claims that the taste is melted vanilla ice cream in a bottle.ù I don't know if I would completely agree with this because the flavor wasn't as milky as ice cream would normally taste, but this is understandable since all their products are vegan and primarily made with different types of nuts. For the Vanilla Almond, there were only four ingredients: almonds, dates, vanilla and sea salt. According to the website, this particular blend is perfect for people looking for a healthy alternative to a dessert or a post-workout protein boost. I would definitely agree with this. It was a pretty hot day when I took a trip to Pressed Juicery, and since all their beverages were kept ready and chilled in the fridge, grabbing this juice was an easy way to cool myself down. The texture is definitely a little more dense than a regular fruit-based juice, and it had a creamy texture that made it more filling. I really liked that the ingredient list was very simple and the flavor wasn't too sweet and overpowering. It was pretty pricey at $8, so I don't know if I would come back for it frequently, but it was inarguably a fun drink to try. In addition to all their healthy and delicious beverages, Pressed Juicery also has freezesù which are healthy soft serve desserts that look like fro-yo, but taste even better. Like the juices, all the freezes are vegan, as they are dairy-free and made with fruits, vegetables and nuts. They only have four flavors, and their ingredient list is extremely simple as well. Their flavors include vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and my personal favorite, matcha. You can build your own freeze, which includes picking a flavor, a size and toppings. They have a variety of toppings; you can choose from berries, granola, shredded coconut, cocoa drizzle and even pink himalayan sea salt. All of these options seemed so tasty, so it was great that you could ask for samples of the different flavors. Pressed juicery has freeze favorites,ù which are different combinations of their flavors and toppings. Some of these tasty combinations include the AB&J, Dark Chocolate Macaroon, Almond Butter Cookie, Matcha Choco-Chip, Blueberries n' Honey, Matcha Pie and Chocolate Covered Strawberries. I went with the Matcha Pie which was topped with shredded coconut flakes, granola and honey. It did not taste like any other matcha soft serve I've had, but it did have a slight matcha flavor and the toppings really tied the whole dessert together. The coconut flakes and granola provided a contrasting texture to the creamy soft serve and the honey gave it an extra hint of sweetness. It was $6.50 for the larger size, but most desserts are around that price point, so it's not that much more expensive, especially if you take into consideration the nutritious ingredients it's made with. Unlike the juices, I would definitely come back to try the other combinations of freezes that Pressed Juicery offers. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Pressed Juicery. Although I like the food and drinks in I.V., some places are just too sweet or too savory for my taste. Coming here was a nice break from all the junk food I eat during late night studying, and my favorite thing was the freezes. It was a perfect treat to accompany a quick shopping trip and I could totally see myself coming back here again the next time I visit downtown Santa Barbara.

on-the-menu,Do It for the òGram,17-May-18,12:34 AM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/do-it-for-the-gram/,"Do it for the 'Gramù has taken on a whole new meaning. Over the past few years, Instagram has given rise to a new trend î food-centric pop-up museums and restaurants. Immersive and often interactive experiences, these type of places have become a growing cultural movement. Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus The Museum of Ice Cream
San Francisco ¢ May 30-September 3 The trend originated with the Museum of Ice Cream in the summer of 2016, which was an interactive ice cream-and-candy-themed art exhibit. Filled with marshmallow clouds and strings of yellow and pink bananas, every room acts as the perfect photo backdrop. Laymen and celebrities alike flocked to the opening in New York, tickets selling out in waves. Instagram feeds were filled with boomerangs of people jumping into a pool of sprinkles and swinging in the banana room; you couldn't scroll past 10 photos without coming across someone documenting their recent visit. Since 2016, the museum has opened in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami, and its visitor number reached half a million last November. The Egg House
New York City ¢ April 7-June 27 This pop-up made its first stop in Lower Manhattan on April 7. As the name suggests, the space is centered around eggs, telling the story of Ellis the Eggling's arrival to New York. The pop-up is Ellis's house, taking you on a tour through his caviar-filled pool and human-sized egg crate. Visitors can spot Ellis himself lying on his bed when making their way into his room. A whimsical, sensory experience, visitors have likened the experience to something out of Alice in Wonderland.ù Los Pollos Hermanos
Albuquerque ¢ January 20 Fans of Breaking Badù were excited to see their favorite fast food chain become a reality during the spring of 2017. With real food to sample and cameos from familiar faces, the pop-up brought fans one step closer to the meth-filled fictional world of their dreams. Missing the chicken the location was famed for, fans instead were able to try out curly fries and a selection of three dipping sauces. The pop-up allowed fans a chance to come together in Austin and Los Angeles to celebrate the show's tenth anniversary. Museum of Pizza
New York City ¢ October 13-28 Set to make its appearance in November, this is only the latest in the line of food pop-ups. This is a no-brainer as New York is known for its hometown favorite of characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust. More about the content consumption than anything else, guests will nonetheless get to experience pizza-inspired immersive rooms such as a cheese cave while enjoying a free slice with their ticket. Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum 
Osaka ¢ Est. 1999 While the aesthetic that comes with these food pop-ups seems to be a characteristic of the millennial generation, museums centered around food have long been around. Many will be familiar with the Cup Noodle Museum, which allows visitors to see every flavor ever made displayed in a tunnel to leave home with their own creation. Since its opening in 1999, the museum has allowed visitors a glimpse at the inventiveness and discovery of this global food phenomenon.

on-the-menu,Mixing It Up with Cauldron Ice Cream,17-May-18,12:39 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/mixing-it-up-with-cauldron-ice-cream/,"The weather is finally getting warmer and you know what that means: it's prime time for ice cream runs! Of course, we can always go to our local grocery store and grab a pint of our favorite McConnell's ice cream, but with so many trendy ice cream spots, you'll definitely want to try them all. At Cauldron Ice Cream, they feature a multitude of creative flavor combinations, freeze it with liquid nitrogen, scoop it in the center of a puffle cone and shape the ice cream into a beautiful rose all in a matter of minutes. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I visited the location in Glendale and the puffle ice cream was the perfect snack to go along with window-shopping at the Galleria and the Americana. When I went inside to order, I was rather overwhelmed by all the different ice cream options they had. This isn't your average ice cream shop with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. I did a little research before heading in and according to their website, they have a new flavor every month. Some of their creative varieties include Earl Grey Lavender, Vietnamese Coffee, Sun Moon & Stars (jasmine, oolong and green tea) and their signature flavor, The Cauldron (vanilla cinnamon with Oreos). Their flavors of the month were Cloverfield, a cereal milk ice cream topped with Lucky Charm marshmallows, and American Pie, apple pie ice cream with graham crackers and apple filling. Once you pick your flavor, you can stop there or take it a step further with a puffle cone, which is a Hong Kong version of a waffle, also known as an egg waffle. You can even choose between original, red velvet and churro for your puffle cone. I had my heart set on the Sun Moon & Stars, but they ended up not having the flavor for some reason, so I decided to try the Earl Grey Lavender with the original puffle cone. Since it was made with liquid nitrogen, the ice cream itself was super creamy and flavorful. The earl grey flavor was spot-on and the lavender added a nice floral touch that wasn't too overpowering. It also came with a drizzle of honey and at first, I thought it was going to be too sweet, but all the flavors actually worked well together. I didn't think the flavored puffle cones would have paired well with the Earl Grey Lavender, so I just went with the original. The combinations of flavors and textures worked really well together, but after maybe half of the cone and ice cream, it was getting difficult to eat. It got a little messy and the portion itself was just really large. I went with a couple of my friends and one of them got The Cauldron ice cream flavor with the red velvet puffle cone. The vanilla and cinnamon was really tasty, especially with the crushed Oreos on top that gave it more texture contrast than mine. I couldn't really taste the red velvet too well in the puffle cone, but it was definitely sweeter than the original. Although Cauldron Ice Cream is famous for its Instagram-worthy puffle cone and rose-shaped ice cream, they are also in the works of new menu items, like their gluten-free ice blended drinks. These fros√©s are layered beautifully and come in four different flavors that match with their ice creams: The Cauldron, Sun, Moon & Stars, Pineapple Express and Earl Grey Lavender. I haven't tried these new blends, but they seem like the perfect alternative for those of you who aren't ice cream fanatics but still want to try out Cauldron Ice Cream's innovative flavors. If ice cream and blended drinks still sound too sweet for you, they've also brewed up a Blue Bantha coffee, which is a Star Wars-themed beverage that's sure to keep you awake. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I finished my whole cone and ice cream, but I would definitely recommend sharing it with someone because it really is a mouthful. Also, make sure you don't get too caught up taking pictures of these Instagram-worthy rose ice cream puffle cones or else you risk getting yourself into a sticky mess. I would really like to go back and try all the other flavors of ice cream as well as puffle cones, but all the Cauldron Ice Cream locations are too far away right now, so hopefully they'll expand their franchise to Santa Barbara in the near future!

With so much of your energy going into forcing yourself out of bed, once you finally do you can barely muster up any more to make your next meal. Before you know it, you have a standing appointment with SBMenus, UberEats and Dominos and the cardboard containers are piling up by your trash can. Now here's a tip from personal experience, if you're already not feeling your best it's not the smartest move to put nothing but carbs and fats into your body. Eventually your physical health is going to be just as low as your mental health. School obviously isn't making it any better. Face it î With just finishing up the last round of midterms and finals season slowly creeping up, there's no time to make sure you're eating healthy. We all know that in the midst of crazy midterm week, or weeks if we're being honest, we rarely watch what we are eating and just need something quick and stress-free that won't cut time away from studying! However, this isn't always the best for your health, especially as soon as you're done with all those tests and realize that you also finished an entire box of instant ramen and spent half of your bank account on takeout. Cooking can seem daunting and time-consuming especially with long ingredient lists and instructions that seem like they never end.Here are some recipes that will be the exact opposite. Not only are they nutritious, affordable and delicious, but they're also quick and easy. Say goodbye to the unhealthy, processed food that you always go to during finals season.

The longest part of this recipe is probably waiting for the oven to preheat; in the meantime you could get the food ready or even continue studying. It only needs four ingredients and they could be something you already have or could easily get. I know our foodbank even offers bread and tomatoes so you wouldn't even be breaking the bank.

on-the-menu,Heating Things Up with 212∞ Hotpot,31-May-18,12:30 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/heating-things-up-with-212-hotpot/,"Isla Vista's very first hot pot spot is finally here. 212∞ Hotpot had been in the works since the beginning of Spring Quarter, making all the Asian food lovers, myself included, super eager while awaiting its soft opening. For those of you who don't know what hot pot is, it's basically a meal that consists of a simmering pot of soup with different meats and vegetables that is eaten with vermicelli noodles and rice. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus A sneak peek of the menu revealed that the restaurant was going to feature 11 different options ranging from just a simple beef hot pot to a curry variety to even a large size of spicy Thai hot pot. First, you choose the type of hot pot you want from the menu options, then you choose a spiciness level ranging from none to flaming spicy and last but not least, you have the option between a bowl of rice or extra vermicelli noodles. As for the price range, lunch and dinner are the same, with regular sizes at $13.99 and the larger sizes at $17.99, but a drink is included in their lunch meals. I went for dinner and chose my favorite hot pot flavor of all time: curry. It came with a curry soup base, vermicelli noodles, pork slices, corn on the cob, an egg, mushroom, string beans, lobster balls, cabbage and a variety of fish balls. I got the mild spicy because I thought the curry itself was already going to be spicy, and personally, I can't really handle the heat. My friend and I waited 30 minutes to be seated, so I was pretty hangry by the time we got our food and I just wanted to devour everything. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The first thing I noticed was that the broth didn't have the yellow curry color that curry soup usually has and it actually just tasted like regular meat soup broth. I could see a little curry powder on the vermicelli, but there was virtually no curry flavor and it definitely was not spicy at all. The toppings, however, were delicious. For $13.99, the amount of food you get is a bargain. They really don't skimp on the meat and fill the pot up with cabbage, like some hot pot places do. I especially liked the fish and lobster balls and the pork was pretty good when I dipped it into the sauces that come on the table. My friend got the kimchi and dumpling soup with the spiciest level, but she didn't think it was hot enough either. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Compared to other hot pot places I've tried, 212∞ Hotpot is pretty decent, especially for I.V. My only issue was the soup broth not having enough curry flavor, but that's a pretty big problem considering that it was the curry soup hot pot. However, I'd definitely be open to going back and trying the other menu options like the Japanese Miso. But if there's anything I learned from this experience it's to come early because there's almost certainly going to be at least a 15-minute wait.

I checked out Altamirano's Taco Truck to satisfy my Taco Tuesday craving. The truck comes from Altamirano's Mexican Grill in Goleta. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus The menu has a selection ranging from burritos, tortas, quesadillas, nachos, chips & guac and tacos. I went for the tacos in honor of Taco Tuesday of course, but also because they had a deal of three tacos for $5.
My food came out fairly quickly and they also had a selection of condiments like sauce and lime to choose from. My favorite of the three by far was the carnitas taco. The meat itself was very well cooked and they added sauteed onions which I had never tried on a taco before. The onions really added flavor to the taco. The asada and pollo tasted like just your average run of the mill tacos, the pollo leaning a bit toward the drier side. They also had horchata for sale, $3 for a pretty large cup, that wasn't on the official menu. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus For $5, the tacos really filled me up, and I'd say I got my money's worth. I have my eyes set on trying the adobado taco next time I swing by the taco truck. Now I want to check out the actual restaurant to see more of their menu and what else they have to offer. All in all, if you ever find yourself walking down Pardall, definitely check out this place for yourself!

on-the-menu,The 14th Annual Lavender Festival in Full Bloom,21-Jun-18,6:44 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/the-14th-annual-lavender-festival-in-full-bloom/,"Each summer, 123 Farms in Cherry Valley holds its annual Lavender Festival featuring its beautiful fields of blooming lavender accompanied by fun workshops and delicious food. This year, the festival took place for two weekends on June 7-10 and 14-17. Visitors have the opportunity to listen to live music and learn about aromatherapy, but the real star of the festival was all the various lavender-inspired dishes at the food stands. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I made it a mission to try everything I possibly could, but it was difficult with the long lines. I ended up trying the lavender beef brisket sandwich as well as the organic roasted chicken sandwich. They both tasted pretty mediocre, but I did taste hints of lavender in the onion jam and the mustard dressing. The desserts and beverages, however, were a completely different story. I tried the lavender iced tea and the lavender lemonade, and they were both super refreshing. It was a little weird to taste lavender in my drinks, and it was definitely something I wouldn't normally get. I especially liked the tea because it didn't taste artificially sweetened and the taste wasn't overly floral. I also tried the strawberry lavender shortcake, which was interesting because while I expected the lavender flavor to come from the whipped cream, it was actually in the shortcake itself. The cake was moist and the cream tasted extremely fresh. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The best food item at this festival was hands down the honey lavender ice cream. I could tell they didn't take any shortcuts with it because it was the creamiest ice cream I've ever had. It wasn't too floral, and it actually tasted a lot like fresh milk. It was so delicious that I ordered another one and I wished they had tubs of the ice cream available for purchase. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The festival has various gift shops located around the farm featuring unique cooking ingredients, like honey sriracha, and I actually purchased a bottle of rosemary olive oil. There were other activities I tried at the festival, like lavender lip balm making, but my favorite part of it was the food. Overall, everything I tried at the festival was pretty yummy, and I would definitely come back for the ice cream alone.

on-the-menu,Farm Fresh Fun at the Orange County Fair,17-Aug-18,9:00 PM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-17/farm-fresh-fun-at-the-orange-county-fair/,"88 Fair Drive in Costa Mesa just recently held its 128th annual Orange County Fair, running for 23 days from July 13 to August 12. This year, fairgoers enjoyed a Free Your Inner Farmerù theme that encouraged them to enjoy uncomplicated summer fun and reconnect to the event's agricultural roots. Reimagined in 1949, the OC Fair offered concerts, entertainment, livestock competition, floral and agricultural exhibits, carnival rides, games and an overabundance of food. This year, the OC welcomed a record number of fairgoers at over 1.4 million î averaging over 1 million since 2007 despite attendance being initially sparse.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Formed in Santa Ana in 1889 shortly after Orange County split from Los Angeles, the fair began as an effort to showcase livestock and produce. Becoming a carnival of products at the turn of the century, interruptions arose along the way as a result of the Great Depression and World War I and II. According to the Orange County Register, the 32nd District Agricultural Association was created after the war and given responsibility for producing an OC Fair and purchasing what now serves as the present-day fairgrounds. Growing from a small, five-day celebration to the 23-day festival it is today has made it one of Orange County's most eagerly awaited events. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Having arrived with my aunt and my cousins who were visiting for the summer, we were determined to do and to try as much as possible in the hours we had. Beginning with the carnival î preferring not to brave the rides and games on a full stomach î we loaded up on tickets which ranged from 40 tickets for $20 to 200 tickets for $100. We, or rather them because I'm a chicken when it comes to most things, made our way around the area, trying out the Kite Flyer, Sky Flyer, Superslide, Twister, Crazy Coaster and Wild River. La Grande Wheel XL, which has a capacity of about 2000 people per hour and is one of the largest traveling observation wheels in the Western Hemisphere, we saved until the very end to get a full view of the fairgrounds before heading home. Along the way we went through the various carnival games, only coming out victorious from two despite some valiant group efforts and boasting on one of my cousin's parts.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus The OC Fair does of course revolve heavily on the showcasing of livestock, produce and local craftsmen; the Centennial Farm, Main Mall and Livestock areas of course reserved for these purposes. There are pens housing dairy goats, breeding sheep, racing pigs and game birds, as well as competitions to see which animals come out on top. This was a heavily populated area with families taking advantage of a bit of shade on an otherwise sunny day and children happy to pet the animals. There were chef demos, wine tastings, vintage aprons and display after display of pastries and sweets featuring everything from Pixar's Cocoù to Harry Potter. Everywhere you turned there was something to see and marvel over. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus While the OC Fair is first and foremost an event meant to showcase agriculture, it is widely known for its food. Offering giant cinnamon rolls, deep-fried oreos, hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled corn, coffee, beer and milkshakes to name a few, the food was an event in itself, and boy did we participate. Sampling endless cups of strawberry lemonade, we collectively tackled two corn dogs, a hearty helping of chili cheese fries and one massive turkey leg. The food was probably one of the biggest highlights of the day, not a single complaint to be heard. Despite being full from the sheer amount of food consumed, I still snagged a large bag of kettle corn for the long drive home.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus The Orange County Fair is not to be missed, promising something enjoyable for every member of the family. A perfect summer event, I would mark my calendar well in advance for next year. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus

It can be easy to feel overwhelmed, especially when it comes to food. While the dining halls may lie a mere five minutes from your residence hall, you'll find that after a couple weeks of eating the same cycle of food over and over, you're in the mood for something new. That's where I.V. comes in, and with numerous restaurants available to fulfill your different tastes and cravings, it's best to break things down. Nexus File Photo Extra Cheese Please
Pizza: a staple in any college student's diet. As such, you can bet that there will be plenty of options within the roughly two square miles that make up I.V. Making your way down Pardall Road, you will find Blaze Pizza, which allows you to build your own pizza with a variety of toppings and sauces or select a signature pizza from their menu. Turning onto Embarcadero Del Norte, you will find Woodstocks, which has repeatedly been voted Best Ofù by Nexus readers. It is also available on campus to enjoy. Continuing onto Trigo Road, you will find Pizza My Heart, another UCSB favorite and frequent site for organizations' fundraisers. And, of course, on Embarcadero Del Mar you will find Domino's, which was a regular delivery in my dorm freshman year. Nexus File Photo Can't Go Wrong with the Classics
If you're in I.V., chances are you're in the mood for something quick to eat. You don't necessarily want anything overly complicated, so fast food or something along those lines seems like the right choice. You're in luck here because there's everything from burgers to sandwiches and burritos at your disposal. Just on Pardall Road you have Habit Burger, one of three Subways around campus, Freebirds, South Coast Deli and I.V. Deli Mart. The latter offers buffalo chicken cheese fries, which are not to be missed while you're in Santa Barbara and which are even offered with vegan chicken. Embarcadero Del Mar has Rosarito and Deja Vu offering Mexican and American food respectively. If Rosarito isn't your preferred choice, you also have Super Cuca's to satisfy your craving for burritos on Madrid Road. And, if you really just need a familiar taste of home, the Grilled Cheese Truck on Embarcadero Del Norte is exactly what you need. Nexus File Photo Sugar, Spice and Everything Nice
As a full-time college student you're going to find yourself spending a lot of time in cafes and coffee shops. Whether it be Starbucks and Cafe Equilibrium on Pardall Road, Caj√© and I.V. Drip on Embarcadero Del Norte, Bagel Cafe on Trigo Road or Spudnuts on Seville, you're going to need a little pick-me-up to keep you going in the midst of midterm exams and essays. Sweet or savory, you're bound to find what you're looking for at one of these. Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus In the Mood for Something New
As with the dining commons, you may find yourself tired of the same old thing. After all, there are only so many times you can eat pizza and burgers. For those other times, you can try out a bread bowl with custom fillings at Buddha Bowls or fresh poke from PokeCeviche over on Embarcadero Del Mar, rice bowls and boba from Hana Kitchen or Hawaiian cuisine and juices from Hiwi Tropical Fusion on Pardall Road, steaming broth and fresh ingredients from 212∞ Hotpot on Trigo Road and Middle Eastern eats at Aladdin Cafe on Embarcadero Del Norte. Your options to eat in I.V. are as diverse as the students who inhabit it. Take your time trying out the restaurants and eateries available at your disposal, and don't be afraid to venture beyond the comforts of I.V. Enjoy a taste of what life has to offer when you're living in paradise, and welcome to UCSB!

on-the-menu,An Incredible Experience: Pixar Fest in Review,20-Sep-18,11:58 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/an-incredible-experience-pixar-fest-in-review/,"As a Disney-obsessed SoCal resident, I knew I had to hit up California Adventure this summer for Pixar Fest. I got to Paint the Nightù with Mickey and all his friends in a spectacular nighttime parade and join the Incredibles family and Edna Mode on their mission to catch Jack-Jack, but most importantly, I had the chance to eat all of the limited-edition treats Pixar Fest had to offer. Here's my take on all the decadent bites I tried at Pixar Fest, so buckle your seat beats and let's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 î Go! † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Jack-Jack Cookie Num Nums: Chocolate Chip Cookie If there's one thing Jack-Jack and I have in common, it's that it's always cookie time. Even though it was almost 90 degrees, I had to try this warm, deep-dish cookie that was right by the Incredicoaster. This is the best a chocolate chip cookie can get. The edges were perfectly crisp while the inside was ooey-gooey and the chocolate melted as soon as I took a bite. Fun fact: The tunnels in the Incredicoaster smell like cookies! † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Corn Dog Castle: Temperamental Taste-shifting Corn Dog This corn dog is a #gamechanger. When I first bit into it, I was hit with a taste of a savory hot link sausage, which I dipped into the tangy blueberry-serrano chile sauce to amp up the flavor. Then, I made my way down to the melty pepper jack cheese in the center of the dog, which is basically the better version of a mozzarella stick. After all of that, I was already getting full, but the complimentary apple slices helped freshen my palette and prepare me for the last surprise: the cajun chicken sausage. It was spicy and savory, which made it a really good conclusion for this massive corn dog, but I could've done without the chewiness of the meat. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Lamplight Lounge: Deviled Eggs and Lobster Nachos I was sad to see Ariel's Grotto and Cove Bar go, but this new pierside bar and restaurant is the perfect combination of the nostalgic Paradise Pier and the contemporary Pixar Pier. I ordered the lobster nachos to remember the good old days and the deviled eggs to try something new. The nachos were just as I remembered them: The light chipotle crema, the warm buttery lobster, the melty cheddar and oaxaca cheese blend and the crispy tortilla chips were all integrated into the best dish California Adventure has to offer. It's a meal and a snack. As for the deviled eggs, the filling was tangy yet creamy, and the red sauce complemented the toast perfectly. The pickled veggies on the side, however, were not for me. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Lamplight Lounge: 2319 and Infinity Fizz The drink menu at Lamplight Lounge is pretty limited if you're underage, so I just ordered the 2319 Smoothie and the Infinity Fizz. The 2319 was a perfect blend of strawberry, coconut and pineapple, and it pairs well with the lobster nachos. The Infinity Fizz is a powerade drink with apple juice and cherry pearls that whirl around the cup. It was perfect for the ògram, but the drink itself was a hard pass. It tasted like someone had melted a jolly rancher into liquid form and served it to me. Unless you have the taste buds of a seven-year-old, this drink won't be taking you to infinity and beyond. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Lucky Fortune Cookery: Color-changing Chilled Noodle Salad Let's get down to business: This noodle salad was a perfect meal on a hot summer day. I don't know what kind of magic Mushu did, but these blue noodles change to purple when you squeeze lime juice on them and mix all the ingredients together! The glass noodles, peanuts and pickled veggies was the refresher I needed to continue all my Pixar Fest endeavors. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus A Bug's Land Churro Cart: Ants on a Log As I said my last goodbyes to A Bug's Land, I had to have a taste of this churro. The Cocoa Krispies are sprinkled on top of the churro to look like little chocolate-y ants crawling on the log. While it was tasty for the first few bites, it was too sweet with all the cinnamon, donut glaze sauce and cereal. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Award Wieners: Funnel Cake Fries Topped with whipped cream and fruity pebbles, this sweet dessert was an excellent way to end my Pixar Fest experience. The fact that the funnel cake was fry-style was super convenient to eat on the go, especially since I was racing across the park to get a viewing spot for the parade. The only thing that would've made this dessert better is if there was ice cream to complement it. Sadly, Pixar Fest ended early September, but there's no doubt that I'll keep this food in my Proud Coraz√≥nù forever. Luckily for us, the food at Lamplight Lounge will stick around, so we won't have to part with those lobster nachos just yet.

on-the-menu,Ichi's O-Fish-al Tasting Menu,27-Sep-18,12:49 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/ichis-o-fish-al-tasting-menu/,"If you want to experience a fine dining experience, make sure to stop by Ichi Gyo Ichi Et located in Pasadena, Calif. I would say this ranks as one of the favorite restaurants I have ever eaten at. From the little details it adds, to its menus, to how exquisitely the dishes are presented, this restaurant is doing it all. 

When I first entered the restaurant, I was already fascinated by its exterior design. It was a sunken design, with glass windows lining the entire front wall, and from the outside you could tell that the restaurant was a few feet below the sidewalk. The restaurant itself felt very open. My boyfriend and I were greeted right away at the door and were allowed to choose our seats. They offered us a place at the sushi bar, where we could watch the sushi chefs make the sushi and sashimi dishes we had ordered, and we took it. When we sat down, we noticed the table was set very nicely; the overall environment felt very comfortable. One of my favorite details of this restaurant was in the menu. Not only were the dish names and descriptions aesthetically appealing, but there were also photos of multiple dishes that looked hand-drawn. After being served, I feel the illustrations were accurate descriptions.

I also believe that the staff and chefs there play a big role in the whole restaurant experience. Not only were they very professional, but they were also friendly and attentive. Our waiter helped explain the menu to us, recommended popular dishes and was very observant when we needed more water, had questions or needed to pay. The sushi chefs we had sat in front of were also very friendly. They interacted with us and explained our dishes. They described what would be set in front of us, even if they had not made it, and were open to any questions we had. Overall, I felt like the experience they gave us added to our experience with the food.

Last but not least, the actual course. Of course, I will not say this is not a typical everyday restaurant unless you are willing to spend the money. Ranking two dollar signs on Yelp, this place has dishes that were just a little above average, but they are hand dishes that really make you think twice. However, to my boyfriend and me, this restaurant seemed like an experience, so we decided to splurge for once in our lives. On the menu, there was a choice called Tasting Menu.ù Our waiter explained that this choice consisted of five dishes that could represent the different dishes/tastes of this restaurant. With the price at $60 per person, I was extremely hesitant and felt that I would not even be full. However, in the end I believe it was one of the best $60 spent, and I was left full to my stomach. We had ordered a appetizer as well, fearing our choice for the night would not fill us, but as tasty as the appetizer was, I felt like we could have easily gone without it. Here are the dishes I tasted: † Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Appetizer:
Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna ($15)
 This dish may sound average, but the taste itself was mind-blowing. The rice was both soft and crispy around its edges. The spicy tuna was not crazy spicy, but was very flavorful, and the fish texture was very buttery. The dish was plated with chili powder and chive oil, which was very delicious and I continually dipped my appetizer in.
 † Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Tasting Menu:
Uni Shooter 1 pc. ($18 value) †+ Wagyu Foie Gras Nigiri 1 pc. ($19 value)
 This was my first time trying anything like this dish. For the Uni Shooter, the uni was paired with a raw quail egg in a soup spoon. You're supposed to drink it in one shot, and once I did, I felt the flavors of the uni perfectly tying in with the quail egg. It did not even feel like I was drinking a raw egg. The uni flavor was very rich and the egg kept it from becoming overpowering. I was extremely excited to try the nigiri right next to this shooter. I have heard before that wagyu beef is unlike any other beef, and you can really tell it is high-grade beef from this dish. The wagyu was the perfect amount of tenderness, juiciness and flavor, and the foie gras served almost as a butter on top. (Fun fact: the sushi chef had also told us the wagyu beef came from a place here in California, which surprised me because I expected it to be from Japan.)
 † Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Chawan Mushi ($15 value)
 This dish was a nice change from the previous savory dishes. It was almost like a soup, with a steamed egg custard filling the top layer and dashi stock (a commonly used ingredient in Japanese soup based dishes). The soup contained a piece of shrimp, chicken, salmon and shiitake mushroom. On top was a generous amount of marinated salmon roe. The soup itself was a nice dish that broke down the oils and fat from the previous dish. The roe was the most flavorful part, tasting tangy, sweet and a bit salty all at the same time but pairing nicely with the rest of the dish. † Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Miso Black Cod ($25 value)
 I loved this dish after the first bite. The cod was grilled to perfection with crispy ends, and the fish fell apart into even slices once I picked it up with my chopsticks. I felt like the miso sauce was the star of this dish because I could not get enough of it. The cod was laid nicely on top of saut√©ed onions, mushrooms and mixed greens. † Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus 5-piece Nigiri ($15 value)
 Five pieces may not seem like a lot, but once you try each one, you'll be satisfied. I am not sure if it is a set type of fish for each nigiri, but the sushi chef who prepared it for us had asked before if we had any specific allergies for certain fishes, and which fish we preferred over others. My boyfriend and I love all types of sashimi, so we were open to what we would be served. The five nigiris were red snapper, fatty tuna, salmon, yellowtail and scallops. Each nigiri had its own flavor: the red snapper paired with ginger, fatty tuna with green onions, salmon with radish, yellowtail with a sweet unagi sauce and scallops with ponzu sauce. Each fish shined in its own ways. It was honestly an amazing end to our whole meal.

Overall, the ambience of this restaurant was spectacular. I would definitely come back (maybe after a year of saving up) and explore more of its special menu. Even though the price is high, I believe all the dishes this restaurant offers make up for it.

on-the-menu,There's No Bad Mojo Here,4-Oct-18,12:11 AM,"['Winnie Lam', 'Rachel Lee']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/theres-no-bad-mojo-here/,"If you walk just a tad bit past Bagel C√°fe, you'll reach I.V.'s newest tea house on the right side of Trigo. This new spot opened up in the summer, and photos of their cups with Storke Tower started popping up everywhere on Snapchat. As avid boba connoisseurs, we were dying to get a taste and see for ourselves how Mojo's teas compared to the hundreds (yes, hundreds) of boba drinks we've had. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus Thai Tea with Boba ($3.49)† Rating: 4.5/5 Mojo's Thai tea deserved a 4.5/5† because of how different the Thai tea tasted compared to what I have had in the past. It's also the cheapest drink on the menu. The tea almost tasted as if it was roasted, as it had a nuttier taste. The boba complemented it very nicely, bringing a sweetness factor that was absent in the tea. I would recommend this drink to people who like their drinks on the less sweet side. Hokkaido Milk Tea with Boba ($5.49) Rating: 3.5/5 I have tried a lot of Hokkaido milk teas from different tea shops before, so I really wanted to see what was up with Mojo's version. Before checking it out, my friends told me that this drink tends to be on the sweeter end and recommended going with a quarter of the sweetness, so I did. Even with 25 percent sugar, I still felt like the drink was extremely sweet; however, I tried the drink from a friend who got 100 percent sweetness, and I felt my drink was way sweeter. It could have been a heavier hand that day working on my drink, but the sweetness really affected the overall taste. Even though I enjoyed it I could not finish it due to the overload of sugar in it. Taro Milk Tea ($3.99) Rating: 3/5 This drink gets a 3/5 just because of how sweet it was. I got this at 75 percent sugar level, but the sugar was overpowering the taro flavor and the tea itself. However, the drink was still very smooth and lightly iced, just as I requested. Next time, I think I would order it with less or no sugar and add boba to complement it. Mojo also has a Taro-ble Taroù blended drink, which would highlight the taro flavor and mask the sweetness because of the added ice. House Original Roasted Oolong ($4.49) Rating 4/5 Roasted oolong milk tea is a must in the milk tea world, so we had to try this. I ordered it with 75 percent sugar, and the sweetness level was good for my taste. Although it was a little watered down, I could still taste the flavor of the roasted oolong tea leaves. However, I felt that the Thai tea actually had a more roasted flavor than this drink. Overall, this is a pretty solid milk tea that has a lot of potential if Mojo adjusts the tea-to-milk ratio a bit. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Since we only got a glimpse of Mojo's drinks, we would definitely come back and try other things on the menu. We only realized after we had placed our orders that we exclusively ordered milk teas, so we will be back for their fruit teas and blended beverages, too. As for their food, there were plenty of customers sitting on the patio enjoying Mojo's rice bowls and tapas, so hopefully we get to taste some of those goodies during their grand opening. Overall, this tea spot is a great addition to I.V. so far, and it definitely has potential to come up with even better quality drinks.

on-the-menu,Taco 'bout a Celebration,4-Oct-18,12:23 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/lets-taco-bout-a-celebration/,"If you didn't know, Oct 4. is the national holiday for celebrating the creation of a staple dish consisting of meat folded between a flour or corn tortilla. Tacos are an essential part of a Californian's diet, especially as college students because we all need those late-night taco runs to keep us going. This year, let's appreciate this simple, yet flavor-packed dish by learning a bit of its history and remembering why we love it so much. Photo courtesy of Flickr.com Where It All Started: The history of where and when the taco came from is complicated: According to the Smithsonian Magazine, the dish originated from workers in Mexico's silver mines, which eventually led to taquer√≠as in the working-class neighborhoods, but its origins are heavily debated. Traditional Mexican tacos are tacos al pastor (shepherd styleù), in which pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning are skewered, cooked and flame-broiled while spinning on a rotisserie, but tacos can be made with a variety of fillings like beef, pork or chicken and garnished with salsa, guacamole, cilantro, onions and lettuce. Since it has reached the U.S., many other cultures have added their own twists to the dish, creating a fusion of flavors between a variety of cuisines. Why We Love Tacos: 1. No utensils needed. Sometimes we just can't muster up the energy to do the dishes, even if it's just a plate and fork. And let's face it: Food tastes better when we eat it with our hands.
2. Endless flavor possibilities. You can get so creative with taco fillings and garnishes and in today's culinary worldìthe sky's the limit. I love tasting the wild fusion creations of Asian-style fillings with a soft taco, but good ol' taco truck carne asada and carnitas tacos can satisfy my hungry stomach any day.
3. It's the ultimate comfort food. Tacos make your tastebuds, wallet and soul happy. Taco Day Activities: 1. Hit up a local taco joint: I know it's not Taco Tuesday, but Lily's Taquer√≠a is a must!
2. Create your own taco: Head over the Co-op for some tortillas and meat and get cooking! It's perfect way to celebrate with an easy lunch or dinner idea.
3. Give the gift of tacos: If you like deals, Taco Bell is bringing back their National Taco Day Gift Set. Priced at $5, customers can get a set including a Crunchy Taco, Fiery, Cool Ranch and Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Tacos.

on-the-menu,5 Reasons Why You Should Start Drinking Vietnamese Coffee,4-Oct-18,12:50 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/5-reasons-why-you-should-start-drinking-vietnamese-coffee/,"Having both parents born and raised in Vietnam, Vietnamese food and drinks were very much present all throughout my life. To this day, many Vietnamese dishes and drinks are my all-time favorite foods and go-tos when deciding what to eat. One particular Vietnamese drink that has left its mark on me is Vietnamese coffee. From being a coffee-hater to now a c√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√° lover, Vietnamese coffee has changed the way I see coffee and I hope it can change yours too! Photo Courtesy of Flickr.com Reasons why you should be drinking Vietnamese coffee over regular coffee: It tastes better Not only is it on the sweeter spectrum of coffee flavors, but it is also still on the stronger side. What makes it so naturally strong (and also turns some coffee drinkers away) is the coffee bean used in Vietnamese coffee. The Robusta bean is much more caffeinated compared to typical coffee beans used here in the U.S. Vietnamese coffee tastes very different from the average cup of joe also because of the way it is brewed. It's a nice, long process since it's drip coffee. I remember always waking up in the morning seeing my dad use a small drip filter to make his coffee.  † No refrigeration needed When making Vietnamese coffee, ones uses sweetened condensed milk instead of creamers, milks or sugars. The thick condensed milk may feel a little overpowering, but that's just how the coffee is. In my opinion, the sweetness of the condensed milk works perfectly to balance out the richness from the coffee bean. Another good thing is that you don't need to leave the condensed milk in the refrigerator. In my family, we would transfer the coffee from an opened can into a jar or container with a lid to save it for later. This way you don't need to keep your milk/creamers in check and won't have to worry about expiration dates since condensed milk has a longer shelf life. † There is no wrong way to drink it No need to worry about the number of cups of sugar, half-and-half or milk, etc. Drinking Vietnamese coffee hot or cold, the taste will still be amazing. The condensed milk can be added to taste if you're making it at home. If you're out and about and decided to order Vietnamese coffee, it is usually already made, so you don't need to tell them how much condensed milk to add into your coffee because every tea spot or restaurant has already crafted it to perfection. In the streets of Vietnam, if you don't specify, you'll get the typical Vietnamese coffee; it's rare for people to ask for no condensed milk so if you ask, you might get some weird looks. My favorite version is called c√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√° in Vietnamese, which consists of iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.  † Not your basic add-ins Even though adding condensed milk is very popular and it is usually what's associated with Vietnamese coffee at first there are also other pairings with this coffee. Eggs, cheese, butter and yogurts can be seen in coffee in Vietnam. I cannot vouch for the taste for these styles since I have never tasted it, but my parents used to enjoy these styles back when they were in Vietnam. † Try something new I never used to drink coffee because of its bitter taste, but my dad made me his version of Vietnamese coffee one morning, and I started to fall into the coffee-drinking lifestyle. I would say if you have never tried it before to just give it a taste because you never know if you'll like it or not! Comments are closed.

Try Cajun Kitchen! With four different locations in the Santa Barbara and Goleta area, Cajun Kitchen serves traditional American dishes on its carefully crafted breakfast and lunch menus. 
 I went to the Goleta location on Calle Real on a Sunday around noon and the restaurant was super crowded, but all the noise and people created a lively environment. I came in a group of 10 people, so we expected to have to wait before getting seated.
We were seated in a large booth, and although we were a big party, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. We all shared the beignets ($4.25), and my friend and I shared the French quarter omelet ($12.50) and fried chicken and waffle ($12.50).  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus 
The beignets were perfectly fried with a good amount of powdered sugar, making it a sweet way to start my meal. They were also bite-sized, which made them super cute, and one order was enough for every person at my table to try at least one.
The French quarter omelet included avocado, hot sausage, mushrooms and jack cheese, but I switched out the mushrooms for spinach instead. The spiciness from the sausage gave the omelet a nice kick and contrasted nicely with the savory and rich flavor of the avocado and the eggs themselves. The dish also came with a generous portion of hash browns, which were not as crispy as I would've liked but nonetheless very tasty. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus 
I also tried the fried chicken and waffle, which is something I've never had before, despite the hype. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with lots of flavor. As for the waffles, the strawberries and whipped cream made the top of the waffles a little bit soggy, so I would recommend eating the waffles before the chicken to make sure they taste the freshest. After eating this dish, I completely understand why people rave so much about chicken and waffles because the sweet and savory components work so well together.  
Overall, my first time at Cajun Kitchen left my stomach and taste buds very satisfied. Their generous portions and superb flavors make it worth every penny, and I would definitely come here again for both the food and the bustling atmosphere.

on-the-menu,Meal Prep Mondays: Stir-Fried to Perfection,11-Oct-18,12:43 AM,['Tamari Dzotsenidze'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/meal-prep-mondays-stir-fried-to-perfection/,"This week, my meal prep consisted of chicken fried rice. I love this recipe because it is simple, it doesn't need special ingredients and it can easily be adjusted for your needs. The dish can easily be made vegetarian by substituting tofu for chicken and vegan by omitting eggs. It's also a super easy way of making use of the basics, making it a perfect meal for a beginner.  Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus Ingredients: -Rice (1 º cups) -2 chicken breasts -5 eggs -Mixed vegetables -Soy sauce  -Teriyaki sauce -Sesame oil (substitute any other oil) -Seasonings (salt, pepper, cayenne, chili powder, paprika) † Directions: Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus This version of chicken fried rice averages around 500 calories per serving, with about 26 grams of protein, 21 grams of carbs and 21 grams of fats. For an increase in protein, you can add eggs or additional chicken. While not everyone has access to Costco, that's where I buy my ingredients. The amount of chicken used in this recipe comes out to about $4, the frozen vegetables are less than a dollar and the eggs come out to about a dollar for five. Factoring in rice, oil and spices, the whole recipe should come to about $8 for a per-serving cost of $1.60, making this the perfect dinner for a student on a budget. To cut the costs down even further, rice is frequently available at the A.S. Food Bank, located on the third floor of the UCen. Overall, this dish is extremely customizable, so you can adjust it to suit your needs and your preferred taste; however, I like it best when you can taste just a hint of soy sauce with a bit of spice. This recipe is enough for five meals, which can be easily heated up by microwaving on high for two minutes. It can last in the fridge for up to a week, though I would recommend eating it over the course of five days, as it loses flavor and texture the longer you wait. Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,Cold Brew in Review,11-Oct-18,12:50 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/cold-brew-in-review/,"Ever wonder why cold-brew coffee is more expensive but seems exactly the same as your regular order of iced coffee? After looking into it and finally being able to try a cold-brew drink, I can finally say that it is definitely not just a trendy drink for your Instagram feed.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus THE PROCESS It's not just your typical hot-brewed coffee with ice cubes. The process of making the coffee is a completely different approach from others.  Time is the biggest factor for cold-brew drinks. Coffee grounds are immersed in either room temperature or cold water for 12-24 hours. Once the grounds have finished steeping, they are drained. The process essentially makes a coffee concentrate. The longer the grounds stay in the water, the stronger its flavor becomes.  † COLD-BREW ORIGINS Cold-brew coffee can be traced back to Kyoto, Japan, in the 1600s. However, their style of making cold brew may seem a little more tedious even though the process is still the same. Kyoto-style cold brew is almost like an art form.  While a single bead of water is dropped into the coffee grounds, a single bead of coffee is brewed, both at the same time and drop by drop. This style is still the original, as cold/room temperature water is being used. This meticulous form can be seen in cafes around the world today. † THE TASTE The big question: How's the taste? Does it taste better or worse than your regular cup of joe? This style of brewing actually makes the coffee less bitter and even naturally sweeter. When heating coffee, the heat actually draws out the acidity in coffee grounds, which is where the bitter taste comes from. However, cold-brewed coffee doesn't involve any heat, so little to no acidity exists in it. The natural sweetness also helps pair the coffee well with add-ins like milk. Cold brew does have more caffeine, but because it is like a concentrate, this style is often diluted with water or milk to almost a 50/50 ratio. Another benefit is that the taste won't change from the original bean. Like with a regular iced coffee, the coffee was brewed hot and then chilled with ice cubes, going through different temperature changes. Temperature changes have effects on taste. With a cold brew coffee, the temperature is constant since it never deals with heat. † STYLES Even though cold brew coffee may sound simple (just steeping in water), there are still different styles.  COLD However, do not get this confused with iced coffee. Iced coffee is made by brewing the coffee hot and then adding ice cubes to cool it. With cold brew, after the concentrate is made it can be mixed with cold water/milk for a richer finish. HOT Surprisingly, cold brew can be made hot by mixing it with hot water. This may seem like it defeats the process but since the way cold brew coffee is made, it is lower in acidity. People who have sensitive stomachs can use cold brew to make their hot cup of joe. PRE-MADE Cold brew coffee can be seen in many pre-made coffee drinks as it's a very versatile base for ready drinks. † Overall, cold brew is just another style among the various ways to make and drink coffee. No matter how you prefer your coffee, there are still so many ways out there in the world to enhance the taste of coffee. For me, cold brew was just another style I can check off my list of coffees to try that will help me on my caffeine-dependent journey through college.

Despite my lactose intolerance and my girlfriend's desperate pleas, I could not and would not resist a chance to sample what would surely be a beautiful spread of gelato. As I arrived at the festival with Lactaid in hand (what we intolerants like to refer to as Hope Pills), I surveyed the five competing flavors in their respective tents, each recipe refined and tuned. Daniel Kong / Daily Nexus Once I obtained my festival bracelet, I began my bestial gorging. Each guest was only allowed two cups of gelato from every tent î I had two cups of gelato from every tent. Each guest was allowed unlimited samples of the gelato î I had unlimited samples of gelato.  In between my animalistic consumption of poison (dairy) and slamming back Hope Pills every 30 to 45 minutes, I found a few favorites. One of them was Fresh Passion Fruit Lemonade Sorbetto, a gorgeous, sour and sweet experience crafted by Marilyn Way of Fiasco Gelato in Calgary, Canada. Daniel Kong / Daily Nexus We've got passion fruit juice from Ecuador and then fresh lemon juice and lime zest in there,ù the chef said, describing her ingredients. I asked her what inspired the choice of the flavor. We wanted to do something really fresh and summer-y for California. Passion fruit has always been one of my favorite flavors and lemon's a top seller in our cafe. It's nice and nostalgic î people love it.ù Daniel Kong / Daily Nexus I also adored La Dolce Vita, a fig sorbet with lemon and a wonderful creamy texture made by Filippo Cianciosi of Gelato Love from Carlsbad. I chose this particular flavor because I like the seasonality of the fruits, plus it's a flavor that reminds me of my grandfather,ù the chef said. Cianciosi described his fruit selection, one that was unique to the other contestants. I love figs. Not a lot of people in this area know much about figs, but when you eat it, it has amazing flavor. The texture is beautiful. It is actually dairy-free, but it's super smooth and creamy.ù La Dolce Vita won second place. Daniel Kong / Daily Nexus The flavors were judged by both popular vote of guests attending the festival and invited judges who rated the flavors. All the gelato served at the festival was made on site in the Mobile Gelato Laboratory, an expandable Gooseneck trailer apparently known as the world's largest dessert laboratory on wheels. PreGel, the supplier of all the ingredients for the festival, made a spread of about 20 additional gelatos to complement the guest gelatos. The Gelato University also hosted gelato-making classes throughout the weekend available to guests. Daniel Kong / Daily Nexus The other flavors competing were Blueberry Basil by Mike Guirriero, The SoCal Surprise by Savannah Lee and California Dreamin' by Noel Knecht. Guirriero and Lee won first and third place respectively.  At the end of the day, despite filling every crevice and nook of my stomach with indigestible material, my regrets were few. I felt two things: satisfaction with the quality of product and ingredients I'd tasted and an appreciation for the art and skill that had gone into each lovingly concocted flavor î that and severe cramps.

One of the biggest fall trends is pumpkin-flavored foods, and these pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are super easy and delicious. These cookies are perfect for staying in on a cold I.V. night or a midnight snack while you're cramming for an econ midterm. Cookies are also the perfect snack to eat in the library because they are very quiet and portable for easy eating. Sure, you can just buy a cookie from the Arbor, but then you might be asked if you're registered to vote or signed up for CALPIRG.

The amount of pumpkin balances with the flavor of the chocolate, so these cookies are not overly sweet. You can store these cookies in an airtight container, and they will last in the fridge for about a week or in the freezer for two to three months (if there are any leftovers, that is, which isn't very common in my apartment). Aside from eating them, the best part about making these cookies is that you'll make the entire apartment or dorm kitchen smell like fall so your roommates will love you.

While vegans tend to get some flak, decreasing your meat intake is an easy way to decrease your environmental footprint. Curries are so versatile and easily customizable and are perfect for vegans and carnivores alike.  Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus This curry has a sweet, mild flavor based in coconut milk, and even if you aren't a big fan of veggies, it's easy to throw some in to get your vitamins without compromising on flavor. † Ingredients: 1 can of coconut milk 1 package of extra firm tofu  Several cloves of garlic 1 inch of ginger 1 º cups of rice 2 tbsp of coconut oil Spices (cinnamon, curry powder, salt, pepper, turmeric, cloves, cayenne pepper, cumin) Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus The curry can be eaten over anything, but for a budget-friendly option, I like to put it over rice, which is regularly available at the A.S. Food Bank. To start the rice, first peel and chop the garlic and ginger into small pieces.  In the pot you'll use for rice, drizzle enough oil to cover the pot, and once it has heated up, toss in the garlic and ginger, stirring frequently. Once they have browned, add the rice. Continue to fry the rice for about two minutes until the grains start to whiten. Add 2 Ω †cups of water, keep heat on medium-high and cover. Once it starts to boil, stir and lower the heat. Add a dash of cinnamon, turmeric, salt and black pepper. Cover and let steam for about 20 minutes.  While the rice is steaming, cut the tofu into bite-size pieces, and use a paper towel to blot the extra moisture. Grease a pan and put it on high heat. Season the tofu with salt, pepper, turmeric and cayenne, and fry until the edges brown to your desired level of crispness.  The curry sauce is extremely simple: one can of coconut milk heated and mixed with curry powder, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and ground cloves. I didn't have curry powder on hand, so instead I used cumin, turmeric, coriander and fennel. Start with a dash of seasoning, and then add more to taste. Afterward, add any fresh or frozen vegetables and heat until they are a consistent temperature. † This recipe comes out to around 500 calories per serving, with about 25 grams of fats, 54 grams of carbs and 17 grams of protein. To increase the amount of protein and decrease the amount of carbs, you can replace the tofu with chicken. It makes five portions, which can easily be microwaved. The curry itself can also easily be made in larger batches and frozen.  An easy way to way decrease the calorie count of this dish is to switch to low-fat coconut milk, which cuts about 30 calories per serving.

on-the-menu,Spice It Up with Chai Cinnamon Rolls,24-Oct-18,12:00 AM,['Rinah Anatalio'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-24/spice-it-up-with-chai-cinnamon-rolls/,"One of the downsides to living in Santa Barbara is that the closest Cinnabon is more than 50 miles away. Lucky for you, I have a super easy chai cinnamon roll recipe to share! These rolls are very soft and yummy, and the taste of chai will transport you to winter break. You don't have to wait in a long line at Starbucks for a cinnamon roll because you can whip these out fresh in no time. Since these are yeast-free, they do not require extra time for the dough to rise, making this recipe come to life in less than an hour! Although these rolls are perfect at any time of the day, there is nothing more comforting than a warm cinnamon roll the morning after a long night out; plus, the caffeine from the chai may give you a little boost to start your day. For all of my vegan or gluten-free friends, this recipe can be adapted for you as well! Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Ingredients: For the dough: 2 º cups of all purpose flour*, 2 tsp of cane sugar,1 tbsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of salt, º cup of butter (cut into small chunks, not melted)**, 1 cup of your choice of milk For the filling: æ cup of brown sugar, 3 chai tea bags, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 tbsp of cinnamon, †º cup of butter (melted)*** For the icing: 1 cup of powdered sugar, 2-3 tsp of your choice of milk (depending on how thick you want your icing), 1 tsp of vanilla extract Instructions: These rolls will last in a airtight container for two days, or you can store them in the fridge for about a week. My reheating recommendation is placing a roll on an oven-safe dish and broiling for 2-3 min. * For a gluten-free alternative, gluten-free all-purpose flour should be used! I recommend the Trader Joe's gluten-free all-purpose flour. ** For the dough, the butter can be substituted for coconut oil for a vegan/ dairy-free alternative, but it should still be in a solid form. *** For the filling, the butter can be substituted with melted coconut oil Recipe adapted from winniesbalance.com

on-the-menu,Health & Wellness Teaches Us Self-Care Through Sustenance,25-Oct-18,1:37 PM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/health-wellness-teaches-us-self-care-through-sustenance/,"This past Thursday, the UCSB Department of Health & Wellness put on an exciting and brand-new workshop called Self Care Through Sustenanceù at San Nicolas Hall. It was just one night of the campus-wide Love Your Body Weekù put on by the Women's Center, which provided a variety of free workshops and classes for students all promoting healthy living. I was lucky enough to get a firsthand witness of this event, which included a guided presentation, free food and a live food demonstration.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Valeryee Jimenez, a fellow UCSB student and Women's Center programmer, created and organized this event herself based on her passion for helping people form a healthy relationship with their food. She defined the phrase self care through sustenanceù as eating mindfully and making a bondù with our food without feeling guilty about it.  Not eating is so casual nowadays. I see people who go 12 hours without eating and not even think about it, when that's actually really concerning,ù she told me. This happens when people are not connected to what they're eating or what it means to give themselves sustenance. Actively thinking to yourself òI'm gonna go out and make sure I get at least three meals today' is such an important part of self-care.ù Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Valeryee opened the event by leading a short presentation during which she touched on the toxicity of diet culture and how it teaches society to achieve the idealù body type. She went into great detail describing how dangerous these trends can be, considering they make us restrictive and promote a misconception that all healthy bodies are thin. In other words, you don't have to be super skinny to be happy or have a fulfilled life! She even shared her own personal struggle with stress-induced binge-eating and said, I would get really down on myself for indulging, but that's only because of society's beauty standards. Instead, it's important to listen to your body and let yourself have something if you want it.ù Her advice was simple, but it was refreshing to hear this be defined as a common struggle. Her openness also allowed everyone to feel comfortable in accepting their own experiences with food. As she finished speaking, she asked if anyone would like to share something they connected with in her presentation, making the topic collaborative and open.  † Perhaps the most pleasantly surprising part I found in her presentation was the information she gave us about the many resources available on campus for cooking or eating on the go. One resource that really stood out to me was the ability to use your student ACCESS card at the front desks of any residence hall to temporarily check out cooking equipment such as pots, pans, cooking trays, strainers, serving bowls, cooking spray, sugar, salt, as well as any plastic utensils, cups, plates or bowls! Cooking at home can be such a great way to eat healthy and save money or even avoid using your dwindling dining hall swipes. She even handed out a list to everyone with all of the food resources at UCSB for students who may be struggling to afford three meals a day. These included the A.S. Food Bank, CalFresh, Emergency Funds and the Swipe Out Hunger Organization, along with instructions on how to contact them.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Everyone was also able to help themselves to a variety of free food, which included options for people with special eating restrictions. Pizza was the main course of the night, with three different kinds provided, ranging from pepperoni all the way to Woodstock's famous vegan pizza. Other snacks provided included chips and guacamole, a variety of different cookies, Rice Krispies treats and refreshments. But the happy indulging didn't stop there! Immediately following Valeryee's presentation, everyone shifted their attention to the back of the room where a Food Nutrition and Basic Skills intern from the Health & Wellness department led us in an interactive cooking demonstration. She explained that she works to teach other students how to eat and cook healthy food on a college budget. One of her favorite hacks that saves money, time and resources (while still being nutritious and sustainable) is cooking a sweet potato using a microwave. She led us in a demonstration with the following instructions:  † † Once the potato was cooked, she laid out a variety of toppings on the table. One of the topping stations was for a savory route, including feta cheese, spinach, broccoli and dill; while the other station was more geared to those with a sweet tooth, including foods like pecans, pumpkin spice, honey and marshmallows (which she suggested putting on prior to microwaving in order to let them melt on top). However, everyone was able to mix and match whichever options they wanted when making their own sweet potato creation. This interactive component of the event was probably the most exciting and it definitely gave me a new idea to take with me to my dorm. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Don't be bummed if you missed this great workshop because Valeryee from the Women's Center assures that there is so much more to come on this topic. She encourages all of you to stop by the Women's Center on Wednesdays, when there will be a weekly discussion space on topics like body positivity. It will be a great space for people to voice their experiences regarding healthy and mindful living through food as well as hear from others. There will even be tea and cookies provided!  † It truly was refreshing, as someone who tries to eat healthy (at least the majority of the time), to hear a realistic message about self-love through this workshop. Healthy living and eating habits not only affect our physical well-being but also our mental health. It is so important for students to continue these habits and mindsets for both the short and long term. At the end of the day, we only have one body, and we might as well love it enough to give it the proper fuel!

on-the-menu,Uniboil Makes a Sizzling Debut,26-Oct-18,12:00 AM,['Daniela Hernani'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-26/uniboil-makes-a-sizzling-debut/,"Chinese hotpot restaurant chain Uniboil finally opened its fifth West Coast location at 5599 Hollister Ave., Goleta, and is unapologetically serving mouthwatering dishes.  Prior to coming to this restaurant, I wasn't exactly certain of what hotpot was, but, upon trying it, I quickly learned that it is absolutely delicious. For those of you who don't know, a hotpot is a Chinese cooking method in which a pot is kept simmering with East Asian foods and ingredients, then placed on the table to cook. This method of cooking assures that the meal will be warm and fresh at every bite. When I arrived at Uniboil I had no idea what to order, so I asked the servers which dish was their bestseller. They informed me that their most popular dish is the UNIBOIL Sizzling Plate w/ Rice, and, without further question, that was what I ordered.  Daniela Hernani / Daily Nexus When the dish arrived on its portable stove, it pleased me to discover that it was vibrant, with acolorful mixture of corn, yellow and green onions, rice and raw egg, and was topped off with the sizzling sound of black pepper steak cooking to perfection. It was a pot filled with simmering goodness, and the savory flavor of the black pepper sauce brought it all together. The waiter suggested that I mix all the ingredients together and that, once everything was cooked to my liking, I should push the special button on the side to turn off the portable stove. I waited until my meat was well done, and then I mixed all the ingredients well to make sure I'd taste all the dish had to offer in each and every spoonful.  After doing some impromptu cooking, I tasted my final creation, which shocked my taste buds and tingled my senses. This dish had a perfect combination of crunchy, because of the corn and onion, and chewy, because of the rice and egg. In addition, the thinly sliced meat was soft and easy to chomp, and its juices oozed Uniboil's authentic Chinese flavors. The average price for a meal at this restaurant ranges from $9 to $16. My plate cost $13.99 and, since it's a sit-down restaurant, I spent a total of $16 (including tip).  If you're looking to treat yourself or someone special to some quality and authentic-tasting Chinese cuisine, I definitely recommend Uniboil. I look forward to returning there to try more of its dishes, interact with its friendly staff and enjoy its novel ambiance.

Located on 5599 Hollister Ave. is Phresh Teas, which prides itself on serving a variety of fresh and aesthetically pleasing teas to both satisfy your sweet tooth and provide great content for your foodie Instagram accounts. Being the tea lover that I am, I was really excited to go check this place out. My friend and I decided to go there, study materials and books in hand, and enjoy the drinks Phresh Teas had to offer.  Upon arriving, we were stunned to see the roomy tables and bright natural lighting, and we quickly realized this was a great place to knock out some of our homework. My friend and I were both in the mood for boba, so we both decided to order the taro slush with boba. This drink was the perfect level of sweet, with a very rich and fresh taro flavor î great for a little boost of energy while studying.  Daniela Hernani / Daily Nexus The taro slush was $4.50, plus $0.50 more for boba. The drink prices at this place range from as low as $3.75 to as high as $4.75, with all toppings costing an extra $0.50. Personally, I found the pricing to be fair for the quality of the drinks, and I liked that there was an option to add different kinds of toppings (i.e. boba, yogo jelly and lychee, to name a few). I highly recommend this place if you are interested in consuming quality tea and having a place out of Isla Vista to study. I will definitely be returning to this place to try its fancier drinks and to study.

A lot of junk food. UCSB's yearly crack-down on Halloweekend provides the perfect opportunity to skip the parties and host your own sugar-fueled, horror-movie-filled night with your friends.

Make sure you remove the marshmallows from the heat as soon as they are melted when making them, otherwise they'll definitely burn! Try to stir in the Rice Krispies cereal and set it into the pan while it's still warm; otherwise it will grow too firm. I found that coating a spatula with coconut oil prevented the marshmallows from sticking to the spatula and made the process a lot easier.

on-the-menu,The History Behind Halloween Treats,29-Oct-18,12:00 AM,['Vanessa Su'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-29/the-history-behind-halloween-treats/,"For people all across the world, Halloween is a time of joy and celebration as †people connect over the custom of dressing up as cartoon characters, celebrities, movie stars and many other figures. As the month of October slowly trickles to an end, hordes of little kids, adults and elderly people get excited at the prospect of Halloween and the tradition of trick-or-treating. As Oct. 31 draws closer, many families go shopping for enormous bags of varied types of chocolates, candies or other treats to prepare for the neighborhood kids who ring their doorbell and yell trick-or-treat!ù Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus Among the classic candies and treats that are handed out during Halloween, candy corn exists as an all-time favorite mini treat that strongly embodies the idea of Halloween through its distinctive triangular shape and white tip, orange middle and yellow end. According to Wikipedia, candy corn was originally created by Wunderlee Candy Company in the 1880s and was called Chicken Feedù for its similarity to the corn kernels chickens were fed regularly. The ingredients used to create candy corn were sugar, corn syrup, carnauba wax, fondant and water. These were thrown together, heated and shaped into its familiar triangular form through the use of molds. To this day, candy corn remains a traditional candy that is popularly bought and given to children during Halloween because of its vibrant colors and sweet, familiar taste.  † Chocolate has become a family favorite for Halloween trick-or-treating because of the many varieties of brands that produce all different types of chocolates. Of all the brands, one of the most popular chocolates is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. These chocolate cups have a soft peanut butter interior encased by a hard milk, dark or white chocolate shell that resembles a pie shape. According to Business Insider, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were first created in 1928 by the H.B. Reese Candy Company, which was eventually acquired by the Hershey Company. This chocolate is immensely popular among families in America and still remains a classic treat to hand out during Halloween.  † Another Halloween classic is hard candy, which comes in many forms, like lollipops, taffy, chewy candies, etc. A popular favorite is Skittles, which come in five flavors (grape, lemon, lime, orange and strawberry) and has been regularly produced by the Wrigley Company since 1974, according to Wikipedia. Skittles are mainly composed of sugar, corn syrup, palm oil, fruit juice and other natural ingredients. They are commonly distributed during trick-or-treating due to their fun shape and multiple flavors, making them a returning favorite every Halloween.  † Halloween has become a fun and adventurous tradition imbedded in the American culture that allows families to come together and bond over the simple activity of passing out candy to other people in their communities. We hope you learned something new from this overview of different Halloween candies, and I wish you all a happy Halloween!

on-the-menu,Inside the Mind of a Food Porn Addict,30-Oct-18,8:00 PM,['Jennifer Sor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/inside-the-mind-of-a-food-porn-addict/,"It was love at first sight. I was too young when I was first exposed to porn. The star: Bridget from America's Test Kitchenù The objection of affection: a creamy raspberry sorbet, made from scratch. It was absolutely titillating.  Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus According to some sources, the term food pornù was coined as early as the 1980s, but it wasn't until 2005 that it entered the colloquial lexicon. As for its meaning, food porn is for the most part, self-explanatory. Per Urban Dictionary: Mouthwatering images of delicious foods,ù one user notes. It's the cheese stretch, the first slice into cherry pie or the drizzle of cookie batter. [Food porn] is usually encountered late at night, like regular porn,ù another contributor added, only that food pornography is far more accessible, populating Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other avenues of social media.  I, for one, have noticed food porn's growing ubiquity in the past decade. To say the least, the niche for food porn is prominent in the digital age (Buzzfeed Tastyòs 95 million Facebook followers can attest to this). I'm not sure where this desire in me to look at food came from, but as for now the scientific consensus is that the affliction is mainly biological in nature. As the journal Brain and Cognition notes, food porn is a form of digital satiation.ù As a species hardwired to chase after sources of fats and sugars, images of food can act as a super-stimulus,ù priming our brains for the sensation of food even when it physically isn't there.  It makes sense then why our tastes in food porn are wildly decadent in nature. By no coincidence, the most popular food porn content isn't tupperware lunch, it's the saccharine, fried, frosted foods that truly elicit a response amongst viewers.  Studies also show that the preoccupation with these kinds of foods, even if it is through a digital medium, isn't entirely harmless either. Heavy food porn consumption is correlated to a higher BMI as well as a higher risk of heart disease and obesity, most likely because the pleasure gained from viewing unhealthy foods is an encouragement to actually eat them. As the saying goes, monkey see, monkey do.  Some experts go so far to suggest that actively pursuing food porn at all is inherently dysfunctional behavior. We take pictures of things that are important to us,ù psychiatrist Valerie Taylor said. After a certain point, the preoccupation with food is questionable: Taylor mentioned that oftentimes those who find themselves the engrossed by food porn are the ones who struggle most in their relationship with food. For some people the food itself becomes central and the rest î the venue, the company, et cetera î is background,ù she said. I see clients for whom food has become problematic, and they struggle to go out and not have food be the key element of all social interaction: what they eat, when they eat, when they are going to eat again,ù Taylor said. For those like me, a veteran food porn user, Taylor's testimonials beg an uncomfortable series of questions. How many times have I delayed something I need to do, occupied with an episode ofThe Great British bake Off?ù For me, is food a source of fuel or a source of escapism? If it's the latter, is it truly as innocent as it appears? I'll rethink my subscription to The Food Network if you'll do the same.

on-the-menu,A Perfect Blend: Natal Plum Smoothies,31-Oct-18,12:00 AM,['Laura Tucker'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-31/natal-plum-smoothies/,"If you're anything like me, you love all things smoothie. I could probably have one every day, if it weren't for the fact that good smoothie ingredients are often ridiculously expensive. But what if I told you they don't have to be? What if I told you that you can make a delicious, healthy and, most importantly, highly Instagrammable smoothie with just a banana, some almond milk, ice and free (yes, free) fruit you can find right here in Isla Vista? Laura Tucker / Daily Nexus Luckily, UCSB's campus is home to a number of edible plants hidden right under your nose! Have you ever wondered what those pink, berry-looking things are on the bushes by the Thunderdome? Chances are, you've either never noticed them or thought they were poisonous. Well, they're far from poisonous î and if you add them to a smoothie, they'll give it a perfect millennial-pink hue.  Natal plums are most ripe in the summer and fall months, but our moderate temperature here at UCSB enables the plum to occasionally even be picked in winter! They grow on bushes with bright green leaves and small white flowers (like those lining the bike paths by the Thunderdome). You'll know that a natal plum is ready to be harvested if it is a deep red color and slightly soft to the touch, but beware î natal plums produce a natural latex that, though safe to consume, definitely puts some folks off. They're a great source of both vitamin C and calcium and have the texture of strawberries but without quite as much sweetness.  Laura Tucker / Daily Nexus Here's all you'll need to make this (literally) wild smoothie: † Simply put all ingredients in a blender, blend until smooth and voila! †A gorgeous fruit smoothie that barely costs a thing! And the best part is that you can just pick up more plums whenever you'd like on your daily trek to class. The more you explore the UCSB campus and the surrounding area, the more you'll find delicious, wild-growing fruits and vegetables hiding right in plain sight. Not only is picking your own food a great way to keep grocery costs down, but it also provides an opportunity to truly interact with both your food and your environment. You'll gain insightful knowledge on our local community and be able to prepare fun, new meals for yourself and your friends. So put on your foraging boots and get to it!

on-the-menu,An Extraordinary Dinner at Outpost,1-Nov-18,12:00 AM,"['Winnie Lam', 'Rachel Lee']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/an-extraordinary-dinner-at-outpost/,"Located on Calle Real in Goleta, Outpost is the perfect spot to enjoy a delicious meal for any occasion. We visited this hidden gem for dinner to get a taste of what sous chef Phillip Arellanes describes as redefined comfort food.ù The restaurant ambiance was sophisticated and trendy yet cozy, complete with vibrant wall decor and decorative succulents at each table.  Outpost's ingredients are sourced locally in California, and executive chef Damien Giliberti's debut menu features simple, yet flavorful, California cuisine with Asian and Latin twists, making the food truly unique. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a delicious meal, take a look at a few dishes that Outpost proudly serves. Fried Brussel Sprouts These brussel sprouts were our first taste of this restaurant and they blew our minds away. The brussel sprouts were tossed and toasted in yellow curry and green onions. They were then topped with a roasted garlic aioli and chili flakes. The sauce was one of my favorite parts of this dish, and it paired very nicely with the roasted flavors. The sprouts almost had an addicting flavor, as I kept finding myself going back for more throughout the meal.  Courtesy of Outpost at The Goodland Pork Belly Bao Buns These pork belly buns were full of flavor, and the tenderness of the pork belly itself was very impressive. The pork belly was roasted for three hours to achieve a perfectly crispy crust while keeping the meat tender and juicy. The buns went through three separate proofs, which gave them that pillow-like softness. They were then garnished with hoisin sauce, sesame seeds, jalapeno kewpie, pickled cucumber and cilantro. I especially enjoyed the addition of the pickles because their sour flavor and crunch really helped bring out the taste of the savory pork belly meat.  Crispy Chicken Wings As soon as the dish was placed in front of us, I was hit with the aroma of fish sauce. I'm a big fan of Vietnamese fried chicken, which also incorporates fish sauce into the chicken, so I was excited to try this dish. The chicken wings were pressed with batter before deep frying and topped with garlic, ginger, jalapeno and a chili vinaigrette. The chicken itself was very juicy, and the batter was crispy yet not too oily, as chicken wings can often be. I really enjoyed the vinaigrette, as it helped cut through the oils and fats from the chicken.  Courtesy of Outpost at The Goodland Caramelized Sweet Potato This dish came with thick slices of roasted yam paired with a turmeric yogurt and topped with crispy chickpeas and a bit of parsley. The yams were absolutely delicious because of their savory and sweet flavor. While the yam itself was creamy and smooth, the skin gave it a nice crunch. Dipping the yam into the tart turmeric yogurt and chickpeas created a perfect combination of hot and cold as well as creamy and crunchy. This appetizer offered many flavors that reminded me of fall, which is perfect for the season! Courtesy of Outpost at The Goodland Pork Chop By the time our main entree was served, we were already pretty full, but as soon as we took our first bites of this dish, we knew we could make more room in our stomachs. The dish consisted of a grilled pork chop plated on top of upland watercress and caramelized fuji apples. It was paired with a mustard aioli and mustard seeds and garnished with dried parsnips. The meat was extremely flavorful, especially paired with the aioli, and the portions were generous. My favorite part of the dish was the fuji apples because their sweetness contrasted well with the meat, and they were so soft that they simply melted in my mouth.  Courtesy of Outpost at The Goodland Fried Carrot Cake When I found out the dessert item was going to be a deep-fried carrot cake, I was ecstatic. I almost forgot that the cake was deep fried when I first saw it, since I could barely tell there was any fried batter around it. This entire dish was made in-house. The cake was bedded on top of a burnt orange sauce and topped with a white chocolate cream cheese and vanilla ice cream. The richness of the cream cheese helped balance out the acidity from the orange sauce, and the cake itself had a nutty and sweet flavor. Courtesy of Outpost at The Goodland We followed our dinner with Trivia Night at the Good Bar. Don't let the word barù in the name throw you off, because all guests are welcome to hang out and participate in Trivia Night every Wednesday at 7 p.m. Throughout the night, we tested our knowledge with fun trivia questions about a variety of topics in a lively environment. It was definitely a cool place to hang out after filling our stomachs with amazing food! After eating at Outpost, we would definitely come back for a dinner date or just to hang out with friends during Ramen Sundays. Make a reservation now at OutpostSB.com.

on-the-menu,Making a Lifestyle Out of Keto,5-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Marilu Bedolla'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/making-a-lifestyle-out-of-keto/,"Was your 2018 New Year's resolution to lose weight? Did you try a dietary change for a week and then went back to old eating habits? I am guilty of that, too. This summer I decided to make a lifestyle change that made me rethink my relationship with food and exercise.  I was introduced to the keto diet this summer after looking on the internet for sustainable diets. The keto diet, also similar to the Atkins diet or low-carb diet, became a fad during the 90s because of its requirement to eat high-fat foods like cheese and bacon yet still allow for weight loss. The keto diet has grabbed the attention of reality television celebrity Kourtney Kardashian, vegans and vegetarians. The perk of the diet is that people are able to lose weight and indulge in high-fat foods while removing carbohydrates and sugars from their diet. This means that tropical fruits, fruit juices, dried fruits and fruit syrups are off the menu. Instead, low-carb fruits under the berry family, melons, coconut and avocados are labeled keto-friendly. Foods in high carbs make our bodies produce glucose, an energy source, and insulin, a hormone that regulates glucose in the blood. Glucose is the main energy source in our body and is used first as a source of energy, but too much is stored as fat. When the body has low carbs, the body starts using ketones a byproduct that breaks down fat as the main source of energy.  The body then enters a state of ketosis when keto levels are higher in the blood, which can happen through fasting or dieting and can take a day or a week, depending on the method. The keto diet is used to treat epilepsy and help with weight loss, and it is recommended for type 2 diabetes.  Keto has made me rethink the way I see food and has worked for me because I already enjoy the foods that I can have and because I already do not consume as many artificial sugars or starch. By following #ketomeals and #ketoapproved on Instagram and watching Keto Connect on YouTube, I have found a keto community to help me sustain keto as a lifestyle. On top of keto, I have developed a better workout routine and do not extensively work out my body as I did in the past. From time to time, I do indulge in bread and pasta, but I do not stress myself out because of this î after all, we are human. Now, after four months of going keto, I have developed my own recipes that are keto-approved and that I can modify depending on my cravings. Below is what I eat during a day of keto: Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Breakfast: POACHED EGGS WITH AN AVO-TOMATO SALAD Servings: 1 Start to finish: 25 minutes 1 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar 2 large eggs 2 slices of Trader Joe's uncured turkey bacon Ω of an avocado 1 medium-sized tomato Ω of a serrano pepper Ω of a lemon 1 tsp. of garlic salt  In a small pot, bring water and apple cider vinegar to a simmer. Once bubbles start forming around the pot, break an egg. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat and let the egg cook for 3 more minutes. Remove and set aside the egg and repeat the process for the second egg. Cook the turkey bacon in a skillet over medium heat until each side browns evenly. Set aside.  Chop avocado and tomato to cubed slices. Cut the serrano pepper into thin slices. In a bowl, mix the avocado, tomatoes and serrano pepper. Squeeze lemon and sprinkle garlic salt on top of the salad.  Dress a large-plate turkey bacon and both eggs on top of the salad. Serve imminently.  Variation: 1 Trident Seafood Alaskan Salmon Burger or grilled chicken can be used instead of a poached egg. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Lunch: SALMON BURGER SALAD Servings: 1-2 Start to finish: 25 minutes 1 Trident Seafood Alaskan Salmon Burger  2 cups spinach  1 cup kale Öì cup toasted slivered almonds Öì of a medium avocado  Ω cup tomato  Ω cucumber  º cup plain goat cheese Dressing: 1 tbsp. olive oil  1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar  1 tsp. black pepper  1 tsp. red chili pepper flakes In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook each side of the salmon burger for 5 minutes. Once ready, remove and let it cool for about 3 minutes. Cut in half. On a large plate, start placing the spinach on the bottom, layer slices of avocado slices on top, then add the cubed tomatoes. Add slices of cucumbers and macadamia nuts. Place the salmon burger slices on top of the salad. Stir the dressing ingredients and drizzle over the salad. Sprinkle red chili pepper flakes for heat. Eat imminently.  Variation:  A poached egg or no protein can substitute the salmon burger. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Dinner: LEMON ROASTED BROCCOLI AND CHICKEN Servings: 1 Start to finish: 35 minutes 3 oz. skinless and boneless chicken breast  Öì medium-sized onion  3 cups broccoli  1 lemon Ω tsp. garlic salt  1 tsp. black ground pepper 1 tsp. red chili pepper flakes 1 tsp. olive oil  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a medium-sized bowl, marinate the chicken breast with lemon, black pepper and red chili pepper flakes.  Cut the broccoli head into smaller pieces. Season with garlic salt, lemon juice and grounded black pepper. Slice onion rings and set aside.  Oil the bottom of a medium-sized pan and place the chicken breast on top. Make three slices on top of the chicken. Next to the chicken, about 1 inch apart, mix the broccoli and onion rings and spread evenly throughout the pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove pan and let it cool for 3 minutes before transferring to a plate. Garnish the plate with a lemon and serve.  Variation: 1 Trident Seafood Alaskan Salmon Burger may replace the chicken breast.  Disclaimer: I am not a nutritionist nor am I trying to be. I am also not promoting thin as a beauty standard; this is just an article sharing my experience with keto. Consult a doctor before thinking of going keto or trying it.

Located on 6555 Pardall Rd., HiWi's previous location, One Piece Ramen is a noodle house that is quick to become Isla Vista's newest ramen hangout. One Piece offers a wide variety of Asian fusion options, from bento boxes and sushi to pork and vegetarian ramen. Their signature, however, is their Spicy Hell Ramen. Hell Ramen has five levels, ranging in personal experience from this isn't so badù to oh God, why?!ù It is served with the signature spicy broth, a large helping of ramen noodles and a few slices of pork belly. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus Being a spicy food wimp, I went for the level one. The high-quality noodles worked perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, though the broth left more to be desired. A bit on the watery side with level one, the flavor did improve slightly with increasing levels, as the broth tasted mostly like broth with spicy oil added. The miso broth, however, had a creamy beef broth that was perfectly complemented by the pork belly and noodles.  The Hell Ramen was on the pricey side, with a level one costing $10.99 and a level five costing $14.99. The One Piece ramen and standard ramen was a bit cheaper, ranging from $7.99 to $10.99. Extra topping to the ramen cost about $1 to $2.50 depending on the topping.  If you are in the mood for a bit of a challenge, One Piece offers two. The XXL challenge entails finishing an XXL portion, your choice of rice or ramen, in 30 minutes. There is also the Hell Ramen challenge, which requires its victims to eat an entire bowl of level five ramen in 10 minutes î without water, of course.

on-the-menu,A Week on the Cabbage Soup Diet,8-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Dahlia Zail'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/a-week-on-the-cabbage-soup-diet/,"I had never heard of the cabbage soup diet before walking into work on a Monday in the middle of summer, back home in the Bay Area. My coworker, who happened to also be a UCSB student, was complaining about what she had ingested that day. I was appalled to hear that her meal consisted of cabbage soupù and fruit, which seemed like a bizarre combination. In my head, I was imagining soggy cabbage floating around in a vat of water. I later learned cabbage soup is actually more of a typical vegetable soup, just loaded up with cabbage. I have included a recipe for this soup at the bottom of this article if your heart desires to try this diet out.  Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus Ally Van Dorsten was trying this diet because her mom wanted to lose weight, so she thought she would do the diet with her. It is relatively simple. You make a giant vat of cabbage soup and pair it with one other thing (one different thing each day). Van Dorsten was eating cabbage soup and fruit on day one of the diet.  The rest of the days followed as such:  Day 2: Cabbage soup and vegetables Day 3: Cabbage soup, fruit and vegetables Day 4: Cabbage Soup, bananas and skim milk Day 5: Cabbage soup, steak and tomatoes Day 6: Cabbage soup, steak and vegetables Day 7: Cabbage soup, brown rice and vegetables The first three days were rough for Van Dorsten, as she contemplated what on earth had led her to take on this diet. Being able to eat fruit, however, was a minor consolation. That being said, things only seemed to get worse from there. The worst day, she says, was the bananas and skim milk day. The regimen allows up to eight bananas, something Van Dorsten found ludacris, proclaiming she can barely eat three bananas in a day. She is also lactose intolerant, which made the skim milk drinking essentially impossible. After day four, things started to look up. Day five was the best day of my life,ù Van Dorsten said, finally able to consume protein.  Van Dorsten was inspired by her mom to start the diet and went on to inspire one of her friends to try it, though it unfortunately didn't go quite as well for her as it did for Van Dorsten. Her friend does not have the strongest will, according to Van Dorsten, which is why she wasn't shocked to hear the news that said friend had quit on day one. She supposedly passed out in the bathroom, which Van Dorsten claimed was due to her lack of hydration. She also pointed to the fact that her friend had barely eaten any of the regimented fruit for the day. Hydration and actually eating the foods you are meant to eat are key in not failing in the diet, according to Van Dorsten. Overall, Van Dorsten would recommend the diet, but only on a short-term basis, as it is not a sustainable way to lose weight. It's only useful for a specific reason like I need to lose five pounds to fit into this dress,ù Van Dorsten said. She also commented on its usefulness as a tool to start losing weight if you are having trouble getting started. Van Dorsten said the diet completely changed the way she ate; after having such limited options for eating, she now finds it much easier to eat healthier and is currently on another diet called the keto diet.

on-the-menu,5 Reasons Why You Should Eat More Chocolate,9-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Anna Constantino'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-09/5-reasons-why-you-should-eat-more-chocolate/,"Let's face it: Chocolate gets a bad reputation. We like to profile it as the diet-crushing, sugar-filled, guilt-inducing sweet that keeps us craving more. Although chocolate is commonly demonized, we should look at the optimistic reality of this glorious snack. Chocolate with high cocoa content has plenty of overlooked benefits that improve mental, physical and emotional health. Here are five reasons why you should be eating more chocolate. Makena Sumi / Daily Nexus 1. It alters your mood î for the better. We often say that chocolate is a remedyù or comfortù food î it can help us get over a breakup, fix a bad day or simply make us feel happier. But why is this? No, it is not just because it tastes so good. According to the Australian Academy of Science, chocolate contains a chemical called phenylethylamine (PEA), which stimulates centers in the brain that control pleasure and satisfaction. In addition, the tryptophan found in chocolate produces several substances, one of them being serotonin. Serotonin is a hormone that controls our levels of happiness (and a lack of it can cause symptoms of depression). We're not saying you should remedy your midterm season blues by consuming two full chocolate bars in one sitting, but treating yourself to a square after some difficult studying might just boost your mood.  † 2. It helps with fatigue. Here at UCSB, we remedy our fatigue and all-nighter hangoversù with Yerba and loads of coffee. While chocolate might not pack the same punch as drinks and foods with higher caffeine content do, it can still work as a sweet pick-me-up. About one ounce of 85 percent cocoa dark chocolate contains approximately 23 milligrams of caffeine î about a fourth of the caffeine content in a cup of coffee and only five milligrams less than what's in a regular Coca-Cola (and much less sugar, too!) If you're looking for the right dark chocolate that tastes good and will get the job done, my personal favorite is Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Bar. It is smooth, rich and not too bitter like most dark chocolates are. † 3. It holds nutritional benefits. Believe it or not, dark chocolate is densely packed with minerals, antioxidants and even fiber. Healthline describes a 100-gram chocolate bar as containing a large percentage of the recommended daily intake for minerals such as iron, magnesium and manganese. This same chocolate bar contains around 11 grams of fiber as well. Darker chocolates with higher cocoa contents also carry antioxidants called flavonoids, which, like many other foods with antioxidants, can help prevent a variety of diseases and keep the body healthy. While fruits and vegetables certainly contain more antioxidants, chocolate is still a great dessert choice compared to alternatives that do not provide nearly as many health benefits.  † 4. It keeps your heart healthy. According to a long-term study conducted in Germany and Sweden, consuming one to two servings of dark chocolate per week, or one square of dark chocolate per day, resulted in lowered risk of cardiovascular failure and lowered blood pressure (Women's Health). We can also accredit this health benefit to flavonoids, which positively affect the arteries and veins.  † 5.It prevents overeating. Although the amount of chocolate the typical person consumes in a sitting is not high in volume, it certainly fills us up more than most snacks. The rich quality of dark chocolate, even in small amounts, provides much more satisfaction than other desserts. Since dark chocolate does not contain as much sugar as other desserts or sweeter chocolates, it satisfies cravings for both sweet and salty flavor profiles. So, instead of trying to go back for seconds, thirds and fourths (we've all been guilty at some point or another), dark chocolate can help prevent overindulgence and consequential overeating.  † Now, don't use this article as permission to down a pint of chocolate ice cream or inhale an entire Hershey's bar in one sitting î that is not what we are suggesting. As with anything else, chocolate should be consumed in moderation to prevent yourself from eating too much sugar or fat. Consume wisely, pick the bars with higher cocoa content and don't forget to savor each bite. Happy snacking!

on-the-menu,Intermittent Fasting: A Realistic Experience,14-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/intermittent-fasting-a-realistic-experience/,"I have never been one to follow trendy diets that force you to constantly monitor what you're eating. It's just not realistic for me to fool myself into thinking I can follow a strict eating regime. Of course, I still try to focus on my health, and I'm always open to trying new healthy habits. When I first heard about intermittent fasting as a popular eating fad, fitness gurus and health advocates everywhere were swearing by it. The thing that caught my eye was everyone emphasizing that intermittent fasting is actually not a diet but, rather, a specific eating pattern with significant health benefits. As if this wasn't enough of a winning case to try it out, I also learned that you actually don't have to change what you're eating at all, just when you're eating. Sold! Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus I quickly began researching what intermittent fasting exactly was, considering the thought of fasting in general freaked me out a little. In broad terms, intermittent fasting is simply the practice of eating within a given time window and fasting for the remainder of the time. There are actually multiple methods of achieving the benefits of intermittent fasting. The 5:2 method involves eating normally five days a week and fasting to significantly decrease calorie intake to 500-600 for two days of the week. There's also alternate-day fasting, which means alternating between normal eating and fasting every other day. Some of the crazier ones I've read about are the warrior diet, which involves fasting all day and eating one large meal at night, and the eat-stop-eat method, which involves an entire 24-hour fast once or twice a week! Each of these methods just seemed too intense for me and my active lifestyle. A more fitting method for me was the 16/8 method, which is actually the most popular technique most people associate with the trend. Basically, you choose an eight-hour eating period during the day based on your own personal lifestyle and simply fast for the other 16 hours. While this may sound intimidating, it's important to consider that most of your 16-hour fasting window is spent asleep. † There are many promising health benefits of intermittent fasting. Perhaps the most popular is fat loss without losing muscle mass. When you shorten your period of eating during the day, your body enters a caloric deficit, which is crucial to weight loss. The best part is that it doesn't even feel like you are restricting calories, because you can still eat whatever you want. Eating just two large meals during the day can keep you feeling satiated while also reducing your insulin levels and curbing cravings once your body adjusts to its new eating schedule. Other great benefits of intermittent fasting are that it reduces the risk of diabetes, aids in digestion, improves heart health and boosts energy levels. † I personally decided to take the dive and try it out this summer when my schedule was fairly open and I could plan out my meals. I set my eating time frame as 12 p.m. to 8 p.m., allowing for a late brunch/early lunch and a dinner with some snacks in between. Personally, this worked best for me because I have never been someone who needs food as soon as I wake up, and I can live with skipping breakfast. As part of my new routine, I made sure to get all my workouts done in the morning before my first meal so I could remain in a fasted state, which has also been proven to help you reach your athletic goals faster. Now, if you're a coffee addict like me, it may seem daunting to not be able to drink your usual cup of coffee with cream outside of your eating window. This can be especially difficult if you are an early riser or like to get a workout done early in the morning and need that extra boost but are still in a fasted state. If you happen to be one of the few brave souls that enjoy black coffee, then you're set! This does not count as breaking your fast since coffee itself has zero calories. But if you absolutely can't bear the thought of drinking straight black coffee in the morning, you will be happy to know that many nutritionists believe that adding just a splash of a milk of your choice (personally, I prefer almond) into your coffee still keeps you in the fasted state since it's relatively low in calories. It's the Starbucks lattes, mochas, frappuccinos and other calorie-dense drinks that ultimately break your fast. Good news is, if you do prefer these fancy beverages, you can just start your eating window earlier in the morning and finish in the late afternoon! Some people can't bear the thought of skipping breakfast in the morning, so they can simply start and end their eating period earlier. It's all a matter of personal choice.  † As an athlete, I chose to test out intermittent fasting purely for the feeling it would bring me and less so for a weight loss goal. In the beginning, I had to slightly fight off a growling stomach in the mornings, but my body automatically adjusted after about three days in. My morning routine also became much shorter (conveniently). While I was fasting, I always reminded myself to drink lots of water in order to still feel energized, and surprisingly, I drank more water this summer than I normally do. Perhaps the most pleasantly surprising part of this experience was that my workouts were more efficient than ever, and I felt less weighed down and fatigued than normal. I was initially worried about becoming light-headed going into my usual intense workouts on an empty stomach, so I began by taking it easy before easing back into my normal routine. Once I was comfortable enough to fully push myself again, I found that I had even greater post-workout endorphins, and I was excited to refuel my body with a meal afterwards.  † While most people take on intermittent fasting as a lifestyle choice, I knew it would be difficult for me to continue such a routine way of eating as a full-time student with a busy school schedule. I still recommend trying out intermittent fasting to anyone who cares about their health but can't keep up with diets like me. I definitely see how intermittent fasting can be a sustainable lifestyle choice because of the ability to customize it to your own scheduling/eating needs. My experience was nothing but positive, and I plan on taking it up again when my schedule is more consistent, as it genuinely made me feel good and productive. 
Print so much wrong with this article. stop conflating caloric deficit with restricted feeding period. why write about something you know nothing about and weren't even willing to really try? After researching and have had own personal experience with this, it works. Stop being lazy and quit putting out negative feelings. Democrats always try to debate the truth, sad. I love Intermittent Fasting! It's so hard these days to decipher what is a fad and what is worth your while and your health. I use these smoothie pouches that you can use during your 5:2 fasting days and they are great ì it makes fasting so much easier. Thank you for sharing!

As a solution, On The Menu has found five foods that not only provide plenty of health benefits but also help boost your daily appetite and energy! Ruby Bruder / Daily Nexus Broccoli  Surprisingly, broccoli is a great source of vitamin C and K as well as potassium †and fiber. According to the Dairy Council of California, a cup of cooked broccoli can have as much vitamin C as an orange,ù which is around 50 milligrams of vitamin C! †Broccoli is generally a highly disliked vegetable, but cooking it a certain way can bring out flavors that are fragrant and tasty. Some highly recommended methods are steaming, roasting and stir-frying broccoli to not only get the most nutrients but also make it taste more delicious!  Salmon According to Today,ù salmon contains very high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and is a great source of protein.ù Though it may seem to have a boring and simple flavor, salmon is actually a very easy type of fish to cook with and can supposedly help improve your eyesight with its rich amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. It is a versatile type of fish that can taste great grilled, baked, with pasta or with salad. When baked correctly, its crispy, buttery texture is excellent for a delicious yet easy meal to prepare.  Mushrooms Although they can be an acquired taste for many, mushrooms are not only a great substitute for meat in many dishes but also a great plant source of vitamin D. Additionally, mushrooms contain large amounts of selenium, which prevent prevents cell damage, according to WebMD. Some great ways to implement mushrooms in your daily meals would be to add them to alfredo pasta, burgers, omelettes, fried rice and a plethora of other dishes. Mushrooms add a great texture in food and are easy to clean and cook, which is perfect for students who don't have plenty of time to meal prep. Eggs A classic favorite of American breakfasts, eggs are actually much healthier than most people realize due to their abundance of vitamin B12 and A, according to Real Simple. There are also many creative ways to implement eggs in all your meals, such as eggs with tomatoes, omelettes with fried rice and breakfast cloud eggs. It's important to remember to eat eggs during lunch and dinner as much as during breakfast, so don't skip out on them!  Pumpkin As we are currently in the middle of fall, pumpkins are a common theme that we see scattered across Instagram, Facebook and other forms of social media. Most people use them as decoration solely because of Halloween and forget that pumpkins are a very nutritious fruit that can be easily implemented into meals. According to Healthline, pumpkins are rich in vitamin A and have amounts of potassium, vitamin C and fiber that are linked to health benefits for your heart.  † Other than these five types of foods, there are many other kinds of vegetables, meat, fruit, etc. that are easy to implement in meals even if you're a college student on a budget and only willing to shop for cheap groceries. Hopefully, this list encourages you to get out there and try creating meals with these five healthy foods and many others!

Luckily, I have four fall-inspired overnight oat recipes that are super yummy and only take five minutes to make! Overnight oats are made by combining all of your ingredients in a container and leaving it in the fridge overnight.  High in nutrients and protein, oatmeal offers many health benefits to give you the energy to power through the day. Aside from those health benefits, oatmeal is a very versatile and delicious food that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. Pro-tip: Add cauliflower rice to your overnight oats! Sometimes, it's really difficult to eat all of the suggested vegetable servings in a day, and adding cauliflower to oats is an easy way to sneak in a serving. When all of the ingredients are combined, you can't even taste the cauliflower.  Of course, this addition is totally optional and the recipe will work just as well without the the riced cauliflower. I know that many people think oatmeal is boring and bland, but these oat recipes are filled with flavor and are a real treat.

I typically use a mason jar to make my oats, so I can easily take them with me to class or the library. But when I have time, I like to transfer my oats into a bowl and top them with some superfoods such as chia seeds, bee pollen and/or almond butter. These oats are super cozy and will transport you into autumnal bliss!

on-the-menu,A Day to Ramemberù,18-Nov-18,12:00 AM,"['Laura Tucker', 'Marilu Bedolla']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/a-day-to-ramember/,"This year, the fourth annual Ramenfest was held at the Kimpton Hotel in Goleta on Nov. 11. Ramenfest was composed of five different vendors, each vying for first place. The defending champion, Industrial Eats, was up against four other competitors: Outpost, Finch & Fork, Bluewater Grill and Barbare√±o. Take a look at†On the Menu as we†set out to determine if any of these five vendors were truly worth of the winning title.  Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Industrial Eats Industrial Eats was the second ramen we tried, and it certainly did not fail to please. It featured both duck and locally caught fish, which worked together to create a unique and delicious flavor I had not quite tasted in ramen before.  Chef Jeff Olsson's passion for cooking was clear in the taste and presentation of his ramen. It was beautifully arranged with an array of toppings (including the necessary addition of a soft-boiled egg) that complemented each other in surprisingly delicious ways. His ingredients were entirely local, and he worked around what was available and sustainable, making his ramen not only fantastic but environmentally friendly!  The noodles were perfect, with a slight bite to them (and wonderfully slurpable). The broth didn't overwhelm the taste of the noodles (which is the case with many types of ramen), and the duck and fish were both melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The 30-minute drive to Buellton to make it to Industrial Eats may seem far, but trust me, its worth it.  Finch & Fork Finch & Fork actually ended up taking first place at Ramenfest, despite not having (at least, in our opinion) the best ramen.  Really we wanted to do something different [this year]. We usually do a pork ramen and we wanted to try doing a chicken,ù Executive Chef Peter Cham said. The process for Finch & Fork's ramen was an arduous one, to say the least: It's like a weeklong process. The broth takes about 48 hours to make, then just a lot of prepping and marinating.ù  The noodles were slightly chewy and the broth slightly overpowering, but the other choices of toppings were surprisingly good î especially the marinated bean sprouts and pickled mushrooms, which both added a unique twist. The house-made fermented chili sauce definitely added a little kick as well.  Outpost It's not just a simple thing that you just put together and make,ùDamien Giliberti, the executive chef at Outpost, said. There's a lot of love, a lot of time.ù Giliberti's enthusiasm and care for his ramen creation was evident in taste.  The warm smell of his double soup method of chicken and pork stock invites your taste buds to savor the ramen.  Gilberti's said he used local meats, which is appreciated since the thickness of the bacon was the star of his ramen. The soy-marinated boiled egg was also a nice touch to the dish. The ramen had tiny sliced scallions, sprinkled chili flakes and crispy wontons that danced inside the bowl, which overall tied in the dish nicely.  The noodles were soft yet easy to slurp. Their wow factor was the nice suprise of a big, sweet tomato because it is a contrast to the savory soup. They get a bonus for being insta-worthy due to the different shapes, textures and colors of each ingredient that sat on top of the soup.  Outpost did everything right, and for that Outpost should be on your dining list.  Bluewater Grill  While this is not usually on their menu but was available at RamenFest, Bluewater Grill provided a tasty ramen dish using local and quality ingredients.  It's a little bit of all the chefs that I learned throughout the years, things that I have been taught, and then just a compilation of what I like to eat, ù Chef Daniela Morales said. Bluewater put on an elegant presentation by sprinkling sesame seeds on top of finely sliced scallops and stringy mushrooms. Underneath the veggies hid a chunky slice of pork belly that melted in your mouth.  The broth was a darker, savory stock that left a taste of spices and pork in your mouth. Inspired by an Asian influence and using the best bones for the broths as well as local and fresh veggies, the dish is a classic, comforting bowl of ramen. The noodles were soft and not very slurpy, and the pork belly was was the ramen's wow factor. If Bluewater Grill served ramen on a regular basis, it would satisfy a ramen lover's craving.  Barbare√±o Barbare√±o was last on our list of ramen to try, and by this point, our expectations were high. Chef Robert Knauss said that this year's ramen was based off of one of their existing recipes (their Duck Bao Bun) but that he tried to make it a bit more unique.  The best thing about their ramen was the origin of its ingredients î everything was as local as possible. We're using stuff as local as we can get it; if we can't, we're using stuff that's as sustainable as possible,ù Chef Knauss said. He told us that he worked closely with many local farmers, which is definitely a good thing to hear from any restaurant.  This restaurant's ramen came in last place and, as much as we hate to say it, we could definitely see why.  Its presentation was lackluster, with sad bits of green onion and who-knows-what floating in an endless sea of broth. The noodles were somehow soggy and chewy, and some of them were even clumped together in a not-fully-cooked ball.  Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Guests were greeted with a welcome drink provided by a generously poured golden cocktail by Outpost restaurant. It tasted like a semi-margarita, semi-mint mojito mixed drink. It was a refreshing cocktail that used a Japanese whiskey and bombarded you with flavor as soon as it hit your tongue.  If you want to pair your ramen with a traditional cocktail, Gekkeikan Nigori sake takes that spot. The drink itself fools you due to the slight smell of alcohol, but it actually goes down smoothly. It has a milky color and thicker texture, but the taste is not strong î the nodes of banana make this sake stand out by giving it a sweet element.  If you need a go-to drink to accompany your ramen, I would recommend Draughtsmen Alesworks craft beer. The beer is a lighter golden beer with a floral node taste. It goes great with ramen because it does not leave an overpoweringly bitter aftertaste in your mouth, and it's a refreshing contrast to your warm and savory soup. It goes down pretty smoothly, and I could pair this with another meal that is not just ramen, such as pizza or a meaty burger.  Ramenfest 2018 was definitely a success. Although Finch & Fork won first place, it was really Outpost that stuck out with its beautifully presented and deliciously complex ramen. The free drinks were definitely a plus, and we most certainly did not leave on empty stomachs.

on-the-menu,The Ultimate Gourmet Acai Bowl,19-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-19/the-ultimate-gourmet-acai-bowl/,"Don't get me wrong î I will always be a die-hard fan of Caj√© acai bowls, but I have now come across a place that's given me a real appreciation for acai bowls. A few weekends ago, I drove down to Orange County to visit my sister at Chapman University, and she insisted that I needed to go to a place called Blue Bowl. She and her friends would not stop raving about it until I agreed to go, and I can assure you, it definitely gave Caj√© a run for its money. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus At first, I figured it couldn't be that special since all acai bowls are pretty much the same. My reluctance only grew when we arrived there and the line was out the door and wrapping around the building. We waited a good 15 minutes in the sun until finally inching through the doors. It was a fairly small space inside, but I was immediately relieved by the air conditioning and smell of fresh fruit. I quickly began skimming the menu on the wall and was blown away by the variety. Usually most places give less than 10 pre-prepared variations of the classic acai or pitaya bowl. Blue Bowl, however, works Subway-style in which you can pick everything that goes inside with unlimited combinations!  † When it was my turn to step up to the counter and order, I immediately felt anxious just in choosing which size I wanted. They offered three different sizes: 12 oz., 16 oz. and a massive 24 oz. I settled with the 16, but my sister disapproved of me not getting the iconic 24 oz. The next step was for me to choose which bases I wanted in my bowl. Yes, that's right, bases plural. I looked up at the board, expecting to see only acai or pitaya, but they had up to nine different options you could mix and match! There were both cold and warm options, including acai, pitaya, matcha, activated coconut, coconut-based yogurt, chilled chia pudding, warm chia pudding and steel-cut oats. I ended up going with my sister's recommendation of acai, chilled chia and matcha.  † Next, it was time to pick my granola, and of course, I went with chocolate. Other options included pumpkin flax, maple quinoa and hemp. Now it was time to add fruit; I chose banana, strawberries and blueberries, choosing to leave out the other option of fuji apple. The Blue Bowl worker then asked which nut butters I would like on top. I decided on a mixture between cashew butter and almond butter. I was then asked to pick from the additional toppings section, which included pumpkin seeds, goji berries, flax seeds, cacao nibs, almond shavings, four different types of coconut shreds, chia seeds and more. I decided to keep it simple and go with cacao and goji berries. Now it was time for the final touches: syrups and powders. I chose to forgo agave to try the apple honee, which is completely vegan! The powders included matcha, espresso, cocoa and cinnamon î I went with matcha. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus My finished creation was layers and layers of colorful deliciousness. Everyone I went with had a different combination, and I was in awe at how pretty it all looked. I can personally vouch that it tasted even better than it looked and was officially the best acai bowl I've ever had. I'm sorry, Caj√©; you will always be a convenient place for my acai bowl cravings, but Blue Bowl really changed the game. If you find yourself in Orange County any time soon, I definitely recommend braving the line out the door to experience these healthy but crazy-good bowls firsthand!

on-the-menu,International Food Fest,19-Nov-18,12:05 AM,"['Shelby Guy', 'Vanessa Su']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-19/international-food-fest/,"This last Friday saw the return of what is sure to be a beloved UCSB tradition. The International Food Fest happened Friday, Nov. 9, in front of the Student Resource Building (SRB). International student unions from all over campus attended the fest and brought with them their delicious treats.  The first booth we visited was the Chinese Student and Scholars Association with its with strawberry, blueberry and mango fruit-filled pancakes. These pancakes, at $4 per cake, offered a delightfully sweet start to the festivities to come. With a generous helping of airy whipped cream filling, the hints of fruit added a tangy cut to the creamy sweetness of the cake. Also on the menu was chicken congee and egg and pork congee. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus Next up was the Southeast Asian Union with its vegetarian rice and curry for $3. The curry offered a flavorful richness with just a hint of heat that was cut by the perfectly cooked rice and topped with green onions. All in all, it was a hearty dish that, unfortunately, filled me up a bit more than I was expecting.  The next booth was the Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA), which decided to sell two types of Taiwanese street snacks: green onion pancakes for $3 and winter melon tea for $2. The green onion pancakes were crispy and nicely fried, which allowed the green onions to add a sense of sweetness to the savory pancake. The winter melon tea, on the other hand, was a nice combination of tea and winter melon, giving the tea a light, sweet tang.  Next, I moved on to the Japanese Student Association for a nice, light side of rice balls. The rice was cooked to perfection and offered a nice palate cleanser from all of the flavorful dishes at the fest. These little side dishes also offered the added bonus of being one of the cheapest things there, at only $1 per ball. Also on the menu was Japanese curry and rice and tuna-mayo rice balls. The next table I approached was the International Student Association (ISA) with its six for $5 dumplings deal. The meat dumplings were deliciously juicy, without the wrapper becoming soggy in the boiling water. Probably the best deal at the fest, these delightful little dumplings were well worth the wait.  The final thing I sampled was INDUS's samosas. Filled to the seam with curry potato stuffing, these hearty, fried delights were one of the most filling and best deals (at $3) that I found at the International Food Fest. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus The International Food Fest stands as a beautiful representation of the diversity and the coming together of different cultures at UCSB. Not only did students have the chance to talk to multiple representatives of different clubs, but they also got the opportunity to sample some delicious dishes from countries such as China, Taiwan, Japan, India, etc. Next year, look forward to a new, inviting International Food Fest and don't miss the opportunity to test some authentic food from around the world!

on-the-menu,Go Fig or Go Home,20-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Anna Constantino'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-20/go-fig-or-go-home/,"I wasn't always a fan of figs î that is, until my grandmother invited me to pick figs from her tree one afternoon. I found them rather unappetizing with their veiny purple exteriors and mulchy, seed-filled insides. Until I took my first (reluctant) bite, I had no idea what I had been missing. Contrary to popular belief, figs are much tastier than they let on. If you pick or buy them at their prime season, they are sweet and delectable. Figs are a wonderful fruit because of their versatility. You can roast them with honey, top a salad with them, bake them into a tart or just eat them as is. One of my favorite ways to transform figs is by making spiced fig jam. I enjoy making homemade fig jam as opposed to buying from the store because it contains much less sugar and preservatives when made from scratch. Jams also make great gifts because of their long shelf life. This fall-time recipe can be made in bulk and only requires five easy ingredients.  Anna Constantino / Daily Nexus Ingredients (yields approx. 16 oz. jam): 2 cups ripe chopped figs (black mission figs recommended)  º cup brown sugar  Juice of 1 lemon Ω tsp. cinnamon  2 tbsps. water † Directions: † If you're feeling extra creative with this recipe, feel free to add more fall spices such as ginger, cloves, nutmeg or allspice, and experiment with what tastes best. The amount of brown sugar added can also be reduced or increased based on personal preference. Once opened, the jam will last for about one month or so in the fridge. If packed into airtight mason jars or containers, it can last for several months if the seal is not broken. This spiced fig jam pairs well with just about anything sweet or savory. Here are a few of my favorite pairings:  † † Recipe adapted from foodal.com.

on-the-menu,A Healthy Taste of Camp Flog Gnaw,23-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-23/a-healthy-taste-of-camp-flog-gnaw/,"Many Santa Barbara students and residents took the drive to Los Angeles this past weekend to attend famous rapper Tyler, the Creator's music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw. Between the long days of dusty air quality and hours standing in tightly packed crowds at Dodger Stadium, getting a bite to eat was definitely a necessity.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Although I quickly realized my options consisted of only food trucks, I set out to find some healthy options offered at the festival. I was pleasantly surprised to see several different trucks advertising themselves as purely organic and plant-based! On day one, I headed over to a green-colored truck owned by Sage Bistro, while my friends indulged in the gourmet mac and cheese from a truck that offered toppings of either bacon or lobster. I later found out that Sage Bistro is actually a well-known vegan restaurant in L.A. The truck offered some of its most popular items, including the buffalo cauliflower, avocado street tacos, orange mock chicken, nachos and more. I ordered a jackfruit burrito bowl, which was also offered in burrito form. To my delight, it kept me full all day while not making me feel gross throughout the festival. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus On the second day, my friends and I chose to eat before arriving at the festival, but by dinnertime we were ready for another run to the food trucks. This time, I opted for a taco from a veggie taco truck that offered four different varieties of vegetarian street tacos, including carne asada with onions and cilantro; jackfruit carnitas with grilled onions and cabbage slaw; aztec pastor with black beans, corn and sweet potato; and chicken barbacoa with onion and cilantro. I chose the aztec pastor but opted for only one taco instead of the platters with three, four or five. Why did I choose to order only one? One reason: money. While Camp Flog Gnaw did a great job of breaking the junk food stereotype associated with music festival food and food trucks, it did not hesitate in overpricing its food. While my burrito bowl the first day was amazing, it may have not been worthy of a $16 price. My friends almost couldn't believe their eyes when their mac and cheese the first day or slice of pizza the second day were both close to $20.  Even with the pricy cost of eating at the festival, Camp Flog Gnaw gave me a taste of L.A. and provided multiple healthy options that even accounted for dietary restrictions. I think everyone who was in attendance this past weekend can agree that having such great food options made the festival even more enjoyable.

While this is probably far from authentic Middle Eastern food, it's a quick and flavorful meal that I look forward to all week. It's also vegan, though I make a homemade Tzatziki sauce that has a yogurt base.†Falafel is a very versatile food; it can top a salad, be thrown into a pita or be used as an appetizer for a larger meal.  Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus Ingredients: 1 can chickpeas Fresh cilantro 2 tbsps. flour 3-4 cloves garlic (to taste) Spices: salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, cumin Directions:  Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus Simple Tzatziki: I like to eat these with a simple tzatziki sauce that takes less than two minutes to prepare at home. It adds a level of freshness and keeps the falafel from feeling dry. This simple yogurt based-sauce adds extra protein to your meal.  Ingredients: 1 cup greek yogurt º cucumber Dill weed Black pepper Lemon Chop the cucumber into small pieces. Mix into the greek yogurt, add roughly 1 tablespoon dill, black pepper to taste and lemon juice to taste (I use juice of Ω a lemon).  To serve: Falafel can be eaten cold, but because I prefer it warm, I toss three into a frying pan to heat them up and then put them inside half a pita with tzatziki, red onion and chopped tomatoes.  † This recipe makes roughly three servings. Each serving of three falafels is roughly 375 calories. With half of a Trader Joe's pita bread, a half pita with tzatziki, falafel, tomatoes and red onion is roughly 550 calories with seven grams of fat, 92 grams of carbs and 32 grams of protein.

on-the-menu,Firing it Up with Rockfire Grill,27-Nov-18,12:00 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-27/firing-it-up-with-rockfire-grill/,"A new burger joint has hit Isla Vista, but it doesn't serve your same old conventional burger. Rockfire Grill has changed up the burger game by bringing in artisan flatbread buns instead of the typical burger buns. The buns are baked after you order, so you should be getting fresh buns every time. If burgers aren't your thing, Rockfire Grill also offers flatbread pizza, salads, sides and craft beer/wine. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus When I arrived at the restaurant, I noticed it was very spacious and offered both inside and outside seating. It even had a small stage inside where bands or singers could perform. This place seemed like the perfect setting for a large group of people to spend a day ordering food and pitchers of beer, watching a big game or hanging out together.  As for the menu, the restaurant offered seven flatbread burgers. I decided to go for the O.M.G.ù or the Onions. Mushrooms. Garlic.ù burger and made it a combo by adding fries and a fountain drink. I asked for mushrooms on the side since I was not a big fan, and the workers were able to accommodate that, which was nice. The burger came with two angus beef patties, which I did not expect. With the two patties, the meal was very filling and I had to end up sharing it with a friend. My favorite part of my meal was the garlic aioli that came with my burger. I thought that the sauce paired nicely with the rest of the burger. Rockfire Grill also offered the garlic aioli sauce in a dispenser, which I slathered on my fries since I enjoyed it so much. The flatbread route was a different take, but I enjoyed my meal.  Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus However, my overall experience was not the best. My meal took 45 minutes to come out, which is not ideal for guests like me who are trying to grab a quick bite. The long wait may have been due to the fact that I went on the weekend. The restaurant's orders may have been stacked, but waiting almost an hour for my meal did not make me a happy customer. I also went with a group of students, and the first person got their order within five minutes while the next order did not come until 40 minutes later. I understand that they bake the buns after each person orders, but when I finally received my meal, it did not taste extremely fresh.  In the end, the flatbread take on the burger was pretty unique, and I'm willing to go again and try something else on the menu. However, my advice is to avoid the weekend times î especially peak hours î or you might be waiting for a while.

on-the-menu,Tyger Tyger: An L.A. Dining Experience in Santa Barbara,28-Nov-18,11:21 AM,['Marilu Bedolla'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/tyger-tyger-an-l-a-dining-experience-in-santa-barbara/,"Tyger Tyger, a new restaurant inspired by Southeast Asian cuisine, opened its doors in October at The Funk Zone in Santa Barbara. The restaurant aimed to bring more food options to the neighborhood, known for its art, wineries and breweries. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus The best dish that I sampled was the northern Thai curried pork noodle. This was a hot bowl filled with thick egg noodles, tender pork meat, peanuts, red onions, cilantro, fermented mustard greens, bean sprouts, chili oil and fried wonton strips. If you like curry and enjoy a filling dish, you have to try this dish. The creamy curry exploded with flavor in my mouth and I grabbed a mixture of noodles, pork and peanuts in every bite. The dish worked because all the flavors played on each other; no one flavor was overpowering, and the curry was not overwhelmingly spicy. With a handful of ingredients hidden in the curry, the dish was appealing in its presentation. Priced at $16, this dish justified every penny spent. Craving a refreshment, I tried the ginger lemonade. The ginger had a strong presence, and the lemonade was not too sweet but a bit tangy. The drink complemented the curry dish because it was cooler in temperature and cleared my tongue palate of any curry flavor. At $3.50, this drink is ideal for accompanying a hot dish or a light, fresh plate like a salad. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus From Tyger Tyger's small plates menu, I tried the lotus root summer roll. The dish came with four rolls that packed together a lotus root, sliced daikon radish, lettuce greens, crunchy carrots and red cabbage. The dish was complemented by a sweet and tart apricot chutney dipping sauce. For presentation, the rolls had a visible pansy flower and were generous in size, allowing me to savor at least two bites from each roll. The rolls on their own were not an item that I would have by themselves; they were better with the dipping sauce or another savory sauce. With the spring rolls priced at $11, I would next time choose to try the restaurant's crispy chicken wings instead. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus For dessert, I had the toasted rice-flavored ice cream topped with Cap'n Crunch cereal. The cereal added a crunchy texture to the ice cream but also made the ice cream too sweet and overpowered the rice flavor. The cup was $4.50 and toppings were 50 cents. You get what you would expect from this ice cream dish î †a creamy, icy and sweet treat. The general manager of Tyger Tyger explained that the owners, Acme Hospitality, drew inspiration for the restaurant from a chef who ended up staying at his current job, but they continued with the concept to create Tyger Tyger.  They [the owners] were definitely trying to get more food in The Funk Zone; first of all, there's a ton of beer and wine,ù general manager Kellie Ditch said.  It has been less than a full month since Tyger Tyger opened its doors and began offering a different atmosphere among the other Funk Zone businesses.  It feels very L.A. to me, just like the way they designed it inside,ù Ditch said. I don't really feel like I'm in Santa Barbara when I'm in here.ù The interior design of the restaurant played a role in creating an L.A.ù atmosphere. I decided to sit down in front of big, open windows, and as I ate, several patrons walking outside pressed their faces against the glass to look at the space inside.  Near the inside of the restaurant's entrance, a small gift shop area with weaved baskets and umbrellas, along with a view of the kitchen area, conjured up a street market setting. The rows of hot pink globe light lanterns that decorated the roof and the white walls elevated the restaurant's atmosphere. Monkeyshine is an ice cream shop inside Tyger Tyger, and I would return to each establishment depending on if I want ice cream, a meal or both. I would return to Tyger Tyger specifically because I did not have to drive far to obtain a fine dining experience or travel abroad to taste the flavors of Southeast Asia.

on-the-menu,Finch & Fork Serves the Perfect Downtown Brunch,29-Nov-18,12:00 AM,"['Winnie Lam', 'Rachel Lee']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/finch-fork-serves-the-perfect-downtown-brunch/,"As finals season approaches, it's important to remember to take a break from the books, and what better place to do that than in downtown Santa Barbara? Treat yourself and your friends to a weekend brunch at Finch & Fork, home to clean, simple dishes inspired by seasonal California cuisine. It's conveniently located on Carrillo Street right by Paseo Nuevo, making it the perfect place to enjoy a delicious meal before shopping (which is exactly what we did). We arrived at the restaurant at 10:30 a.m. on a Saturday and were promptly seated at the terrace. We noticed that the terrace had large windows that let in plenty of sunlight, and the table arrangement made the room feel very open. The terrace was an excellent spot to dine at for brunch, and the dining room and bar on the other side of the restaurant seemed very cozy and sophisticated, which would be great for a dinner date. We admired the notably crafted environment of the restaurant, but we were even more impressed when we got a taste of the food. We wanted to obtain the full experience of Finch & Fork's weekend brunch, so we ordered breakfast, lunch and dessert items.  Courtesy of Finch & Fork To start off, we tried the Deviled Eggs with smoked trout, pickled shallot and olive relish. We appreciated the visual artistry of the appetizer; all the colors of the dish stood out to make our mouths water. Despite being soaked in beet juice to acquire their vibrant magenta color, the eggs retained their flavor and we couldn't taste any beets at all, which was a plus. The filling was creamy, but the real highlight of the dish was the smoked trout. Without the fish, this would've tasted similar to other deviled eggs we've tried in the past, but the smoky flavor from the fish gave it the kick it needed to make us hungry for more. Courtesy of Finch & Fork As for the breakfast items, we tried the Short Rib and Sweet Potato Hash as well as the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. The Short Rib and Sweet Potato Hash was topped with sunny-side-up eggs, fresh horseradish and a chimichurri sauce. The fresh horseradish and chimichurri sauce was what made this dish really stand out. They both brought a sweet and savory flavor that paired nicely with the short rib. In particular, the horseradish provided a refreshing taste that helped cut out the fattiness from the meat. The short rib was very tender, falling apart by the fork. It was also a generous amount for a breakfast item. The Roasted Pork Belly Benedict seemed like a restaurant favorite as our server highly recommend it. The dish was a different take on the egg benedict, as it used pork belly instead of canadian bacon and added a twist to the hollandaise. It also came with a side of home fries that is worth highlighting because they were very light and not oily as many restaurants tend to make them. The crispy pork belly paired nicely with the whole dish. The chipotle hollandaise added a spicy touch while not overwhelming the dish. The eggs were perfectly poached and the muffin tasted very fresh. On its own, the muffin had a sweet and pillowy taste. It managed to not become soggy even after being topped with egg yolk and sauce. When we were cutting through the dish, we were surprised by how easy it felt; nothing fell apart or was too tough.  Courtesy of Finch & Fork We also ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich from the lunch menu, which was more than impressive. The crisp, garlic fries alone were delicious when paired with the jalapeno aioli, and the burger was an exquisite symphony of flavors and textures. The chicken had a thin batter, making it extra crispy while retaining the moisture of the meat inside. The fresh-tasting kale slaw and pickles offered a nice flavor contrast to the chicken, while the pillowy toasted buns provided a soft exterior to each bite. The smoked honey mustard sauce tied everything together, which made this the best chicken sandwich my friends and I have ever had before. In addition to the food, we also tried one of the pressed juices Finch & Fork offers. After lengthy consideration (they all sounded so delicious!), we decided on the Santa Barbara, which is made with pineapple, orange, apple, strawberry, lemon and mint. The fruity flavors complemented our food nicely, and the drink overall was light and refreshing, especially with the hint of mint flavor at the end of each sip. We would definitely come back to try the rest of the pressed juices, as the Santa Barbara was a perfect pair to our delicious brunch. Courtesy of Finch & Fork To end our meal, we shared the Fire Roasted Milk Shake, made with a blend of caramelized banana and McConnell's vanilla ice cream. The shake was drizzled with salted caramel, dusted with crushed graham cracker and topped off with a toasted meringue. The shake had a very frothy texture; however, it did not weigh us down after finishing it. Still, we recommend sharing it unless you have a major sweet tooth. The shake presented a very warm, autumn feel and was a perfect finish to our meal.

E. coli is short for Escherichia coli and is a form of bacteria that is found in the lower intestine of the human body. This bacteria is dangerous because it can cause extreme anemia and kidney failure, which can lead to death in some serious instances. Romaine lettuce is found in most pre-packaged salads and fast food salads. The source of the E. coli outbreak has been linked to California, so if you still have any romaine, please get rid of it! If you still want to enjoy a nice salad sans romaine, here are some alternatives you can try: Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Salads may have a reputation of being boring, but they don't have to be! You can avoid a boring salad by incorporating new foods and toppings. Some of my favorite salad additions are chickpeas, tomatoes, sunflower greens and a fried egg. I like to make my salads as colorful as possible by adding one food for each color of the rainbow. †So next time you make a salad, skip the romaine and pile on some other nutrient-dense alternatives!

One of my favorite places to shop for unique and affordable holiday treats is Trader Joe's, since they're not only exceptional in presentation but also in flavor. Their Fearless Flyer Shopping List can be overwhelming for those of us who are just looking for a few Christmas munchies, so here's a condensed list of what I think are the most worthy treats for this holiday season. Courtesy of traderjoes.com Bits of mini pretzels are tossed into the decadent sweet toffee to create the perfect combo of sweet, salty and crunchy. Priced at only $2.99, these are a steal and are sure to be gone within minutes of a holiday celebration. Courtesy of traderjoes.com This pastry is baked into the cutest snowflake shape and dusted with powdered sugar, so it'll definitely get you into the holiday spirit. It's rich in almond and cocoa flavors, and if you pop it in the oven for just a few minutes, your whole house will smell like Christmas. Courtesy of traderjoes.com Trader Joe's Jingle Jangle mix is a cauldron of chocolatey goodness. This assortment of mini pretzels, caramel popcorn, Joe-Joe's cookies and peanut butter cups are all generously coated with milk, dark and white chocolate. Mix a few handfuls of Jingle Jangle into vanilla ice cream and you'll have the ultimate holiday dessert in no time. Courtesy of traderjoes.com This box of 12 pretzels includes dark chocolate with chopped almonds, milk chocolate with rainbow sprinkles and dark chocolate with crushed peppermint. Again, Trader Joe's impressively cultivates sweet and salty flavors for an assortment that is great to give as a gift or just to enjoy with friends and family.

The popcorn is coated in salted caramel, dark chocolate and white chocolate and dusted with crushed peppermint pieces. It comes in a cute and festive resealable bag if you want to save some for later, but you probably won't. Courtesy of traderjoes.com Almond Nog is pretty underrated, but this dairy-free holiday beverage is just as rich, creamy and delicious as normal egg nog. Add it to your coffee for a festive kick, or just drink it by itself to fully appreciate how Trader Joe's actually came up with a way to make eggnog dairy-free, kosher certified and vegan. Courtesy of traderjoes.com This ice cream is inspired by ancient Yule log cakes.

They're perfect for a holiday get-together; or, if you're like me, just stock up on these before they disappear until next year.

on-the-menu,Don't Nog It òTill You Try It,14-Dec-18,12:00 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-14/dont-nog-it-till-you-try-it/,"With the holidays right around the corner, everything that is tied to either Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or any other December holiday is in season î whether it's holiday-themed sweaters, food, drinks, etc. One thing that I've always been interested in is eggnog. What exactly is eggnog and why is everyone so hyped up about it, especially during this Christmas season? Courtesy of Maxpixel.net If you don't already know, eggnog is a mixture of beaten eggs, cream, milk and flavorings often combined with alcohol. What surprised me most was that the eggs incorporated into the drink are raw. Yes, these eggs are only whisked and beaten along with the rest of the ingredients. A big, red flag screaming SALMONELLAù popped up in my mind when I learned how eggnog was made. The FDA actually advises people to use a cooked egg base when making eggnog, since young children, pregnant women and the elderly are at high risk for this infection. They also advise to not always count on the alcohol being added in to kill the salmonella. Since I would never want to be at risk for salmonella at a Christmas party, I wondered how this drink came to be. According to Time magazine, the origins of eggnog can be traced to thousands of centuries ago in Britain, where drinks had similar raw egg-like bases. This seasonal drink spread to different countries, each adopting their own version. We can see that in early America, colonists had all the raw material to make this drink: cows, chickens and alcohol. But why is this drink tied to Christmas? Eggnog is a warm, heated drink, and in Britain the drink was for the wealthy, who often drank it during the cold winters. Only the wealthy could afford eggnog, as the spices used and the quality alcohol added was far too expensive for the poor to afford. The quality and accessibility of the alcohol used could also be a reason as to why this drink is only for special occasions, as even the wealthy did not drink it regularly. Nowadays, these ingredients are offered almost everywhere and at any time of the year, but you only see eggnog being sold or consumed around Christmastime. This could be because people just want to keep the tradition alive since it has existed for so long. I myself have never tasted eggnog and am not sure how willing I would be if I had the chance, but if you're someone who hasn't but is yearning to, 'tis the season to go try it. Even if you don't want to go out and buy it, the ingredients seem easy enough to make it at home. I would just recommend to not risk getting salmonella and maybe look for recipes that have their eggs somewhat cooked!

on-the-menu,Healthy and Simple Peppermint Treats,20-Dec-18,9:07 PM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-20/healthy-and-simple-peppermint-treats/,"The holidays are here, which means it's the time for extravagant baking and festive treats. If there's any flavor that's reminiscent of the holiday season, it's peppermint. Sometimes baking isn't always for everyone, though, and an overload on sugary sweets doesn't end well. As an alternative, here are three easier and healthier peppermint treats anyone can make and enjoy this holiday season. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Vanilla Candy Cane Chia Pudding Ingredients: æ cup of milk (I used almond) 2 tbsp of chia seeds Ω tsp of vanilla extract Ω tsp of peppermint extract 1 tsp of maple syrup Directions: 1. Mix all ingredients together in a jar. 2. Leave in the fridge overnight or for at least three hours. 3. Shake halfway through to prevent chia seeds from sinking to the bottom. 4. Top with crushed candy cane and fruit. Enjoy in the morning with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate! Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Peppermint Mocha Smoothie Ingredients: 1 overripe banana 2 tbsp of raw cacao powder (cocoa powder works just as well) 1 tsp of peppermint extract Ω cup of coffee 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder (optional) a splash of milk (I used coconut) Directions: 1. Put all ingredients into high-speed blender. 2. Top with a candy cane and raw cacao nibs (or chocolate chips). This smoothie can work as a filling breakfast, a post-workout snack or even a midnight treat. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus No-Bake Chocolate Peppermint Balls Ingredients: 1 cup of almonds 1 cup of pitted dates º cup of cocoa powder 1 tsp of peppermint extract 4 tsp of milk of your choice Crushed candy cane (topping) Directions: 1. Place almonds and dates in food processor, pulsing several times. 2. Add in cocoa powder, peppermint and milk (one teaspoon at a time) until mixed well. 3. Form mixture into balls. 4. Roll in crushed candy cane as a topping. 5. Place in fridge overnight or for at least four hours. 6. Enjoy! † Each of these treats puts a healthy and manageable twist on everyone's favorite holiday flavor. They also all can be made vegan just by using non-dairy milks or nut-free by eliminating the almonds in the peppermint balls!

on-the-menu,Fa La La La Latte: Your Guide to Starbucks Holiday Drinks,25-Dec-18,12:00 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-25/fa-la-la-la-latte-your-guide-to-starbucks-holiday-drinks/,"The red cups at Starbucks have always been a symbol of the holiday season. Whether you're walking around to see the Christmas lights, enjoying a night in filled with cheesy holiday movies or simply craving a feel-good treat when the weather gets colder, Starbucks holiday drinks are a family tradition. However, most people don't even know all the possible options Starbucks offers for its seasonal drinks. This year, I made it my goal to find the best-tasting holiday drink by trying every single one. In order to prevent you from ordering an underwhelming drink in the future, here is an honest review and ranking of each Starbucks holiday drink from worst to best.  Courtesy of flickr.com #12. Juniper Latte This is actually the most recent addition to the holiday collection. It has been widely advertised as tasting like a Christmas tree in a cup,ù which should've been a red flag from the beginning. Unless you find the taste of pine in your coffee particularly appetizing and are ready to spend $5 on a drink lacking flavor, skip this one. † #11. Salted Caramel Mocha For some reason this combination just didn't work well together. The perfect balance between salty and sweet I was expecting was counteracted by the overpowering salted caramel. The chocolate in the mocha was less prominent than I would've hoped, and I think there was just a little too much going on in one drink. † #10. Toasted White Chocolate Mocha Although I ranked this one pretty low, it's actually a pretty good drink. The disappointing thing about it was that it just tasted like a typical plain white mocha. I had high expectations with everyone telling me it tasted like a toasted marshmallow, but I was ultimately left disappointed. † #9. Gingerbread Latte The gingerbread latte is a good choice for anyone who enjoys the flavor of holiday spices. The drink bursts with nutmeg and cinnamon and pairs well with coconut milk. However, if you're expecting it to taste like an actual gingerbread cookie (like I was), don't get your hopes up. † #8. Christmas Blend Coffee I had to rank the classic Starbucks Christmas blend a little high just because you really can't go wrong with it. Whether you pair it with half and half or almond milk, it's the perfect substitute for your basic cup of coffee but with the essence of holiday warmth. It also pairs well with the seasonal Cranberry Bliss Bars. † #7. Eggnog Latte I'm not usually someone who reaches for eggnog during the holidays, so this one wasn't my favorite. However, if you are an eggnog lover, you MUST try this one. Everyone I know who does enjoy eggnog swears it is the best drink for the holidays. It's pretty sweet, but I recommend adding a shot of espresso to balance it out. † #6. Peppermint Hot Chocolate If you're looking for something without caffeine, this is the perfect late-night treat that always reminds me of the holidays. Starbucks hot cocoa is super rich and pairs so well with its peppermint syrup. † #5. Caramel Brulee Latte While the salted caramel mocha may have misused some of its flavors, the caramel brulee had the perfect essence of salted caramel. Surprisingly, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet or heavy and I would definitely order it again. † #4. White Peppermint Mocha This one is the perfect option if you are looking for more of a dessert or treat, considering it's one of the sweetest drinks out of all the ones I've tried. It definitely overshadowed the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha and even gave me another option for when I need breaks from my beloved classic Peppermint Mocha. † #3. Chestnut Praline Latte Chestnut Praline was another pleasant surprise from this experience and now has become one of my favorite coffee drinks of all time. It's the perfect option for a long day at school or work and provides a sense of warmth with its subtle flavors. I recommend trying it with coconut milk!  † #2. Snickerdoodle Hot Chocolate This is definitely another dessert drink option, but I swear this drink tastes exactly like a snickerdoodle cookie in liquid form. The barista told me they actually use a white chocolate base for the cocoa and then add their cinnamon dolce syrup to create this delicious concoction. It has been the consistent crowd favorite of my family and friends this season. † #1. Peppermint Mocha Last and certainly not least is my long-time favorite, the Peppermint Mocha. I admit I may be a little biased because I have been ordering this drink every holiday season for as long as I can remember. It's just a classic taste of the holidays with the rich mocha and peppermint, without any excessive flavors. It will always be my go-to! Comments are closed.

Take a look at 18 different trends that came out of 2018 and decide for yourself whether they'll continue or phase out in the upcoming years! Courtesy of maxpixel.com Gut-friendlyù foods and drink
2018 saw a rise in pickled and fermented vegetables like kimchi, sauerkraut and miso and prebiotics such as garlic and onions. The gut-friendlyù trend also applies to beverages, as many different brands and flavors of kombucha, a fermented black or green tea drink, hit the shelves. These foods and drinks became popular because of their health benefits, such as aiding digestion. Protein-rich seeds
Chia seeds, hemp seeds and flax seeds have become common additions to smoothie bowls, yogurt, oatmeal and plenty of other foods. They add a nice unique texture to whatever you put them in and they're highly nutritious! Irene Wang / Daily Nexus Rolled ice cream
Thai rolled ice cream gained popularity because of its fun method of preparation. A milk and cream mixture is chopped and stirred on an ice pan until it solidifies and is then rolled and decorated with tons of fun toppings such as pretzels, cookies and whipped cream. Matcha
In 2018, it seemed like almost every cafe or dessert spot had matcha on the menu. From matcha soft serve to matcha lattes, this green tea powder has dominated the dessert world. Since one serving of matcha tea is the equivalent of 10 cups of regular green tea, it's sure to keep you awake and it even has more antioxidants than loose leaf tea for that health boost we all need. Hand-made boba
A few boba shops elevated their game in 2018 by hand-making their own boba in-house. By making boba from scratch, a variety of different flavors, like taro or black sesame, can be incorporated into each tapioca ball, making your drink even more flavorful. Acai bowls
It's no doubt that acai bowls grew in popularity, even more so than previous years. Acai bowls are a quick, tasty snack you can grab from a local cafe, which makes it good to satisfy your cravings and spruce up your Instagram feed. 2018 saw the addition of new flavors for smoothie bowls and a variety of different toppings. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Hot pot
Hot pot soup rose in popularity, especially during the chillier months, because of its wide array of flavor options. You can customize anything from the flavor of your soup to the types of meats and vegetables in your hot pot. UCSB students definitely experienced this food trend with the grand opening of not one, but two new hot pot restaurants in the area. Plant-based cuisine
As people became more health-conscious, they leaned more toward a plant-based diet based on foods made from vegetables, whole grains, seeds, nuts and fruits. Restaurants picked up on this trend and introduced more plant-based options in their menus, as plant-based cuisine is often high in fiber and provides many health benefits. Zero-waste cooking
Sustainability was a big issue in 2018, so cooks and restaurants tried to incorporate no-waste cooking into their meals. Nose to tailù cooking means using as many parts of an animal as possible to reduce waste and while we saw a lot of this, plants were also included this year, subsequently termed stem to leafù cooking. House-made condiments
Heinz Tomato Ketchup will always be a favorite, but house-made chipotle mayo and Sriracha-infused ketchup innovated the condiment industry in 2018. Restaurants whipped up their own unique creations to pair with fries, burgers and much more. With this many new creations and combos, the possibilities are endless. Street-food inspired dishes
Many restaurants offered an elevated twist to classic street foods like tacos and hot dogs. Restaurants often fuse flavors from different cultural cuisines to make a unique creation and provide customers with street-food cuisine at a sit-down restaurant. Courtesy of pixabay.com Carb substitutions
With the increasing use of vegetable spiralizers, carb substitutions gained a lot of popularity since they could be incorporated into pasta dishes and many other classic meals. This is perfect for people on a low-carb diet and will surely become more common in upcoming years. Ugly produce
2018 saw the start of the ugly produce movement, as companies like Imperfect Produce advertised their delivery boxes filled with flawed vegetables and fruits for low prices. Purchasing imperfect produce reduces food waste and saves billions of gallons of water. Microgreens
Microgreens are harvested after sprouting and in 2018 they were used largely for a visual component in many dishes. Their delicate texture and vibrant colors made it perfect for photos and help any dish look both healthy and tasty. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Overnight oats
Overnight oats gained popularity last year because of their convenience and customizability. It's perfect to make the night before a busy morning and you can add fruits, nuts and seeds as desired. Upgraded Chicken and Waffles
In 2018, fun creations like popcorn chicken in waffle cones and chicken and waffles on a stick gained attention on social media for their unique twists on one of our favorite sweet and savory combos. Soft serve
While a classic vanilla cone is sure to satisfy our sweet tooth, a variety of different soft serve flavors reached the market in 2018 and took the ice cream game to the next level. Some of these funky flavors include activated charcoal, ube, watermelon and corn. Many dessert shops even swirl different flavors together for double the fun. Courtesy of flickr.com  Filled doughnuts
Many boutique doughnut shops popped up in 2018 with unique flavors and fillings. Some include Nutella-filled doughnuts, s'mores doughnuts and cereal-covered doughnuts.

Birthday cake! However, the typical frosted, sprinkled cake you usually eat on your birthday is not a norm that you can find outside of the United States. Recently, I traveled to Denmark and was able to see how birthdays are celebrated there. Specifically, what is their version of birthday cake? It started to make me think: what are other countries' special birthday foods? Image courtesy of maxpixel.net United States: Birthday Cake It's never truly a birthday party without presenting a birthday cake to the birthday boy or girl while singing Happy Birthday.ù Most western cultures celebrate with a cake, lit candles and a song. The candles usually represent the age the person is turning. Many believe when blowing out the candles all at once, a silent wish can be made. However, this wish must be kept a secret for it to become true. † Denmark: F√∏dselsdagsboller While visiting Denmark I was able to celebrate my cousin's birthday and see the Danish traditions. Their big birthday food are buns called F√∏dselsdagsboller that are eaten during breakfast. They are your typical flour, sugar and butter mix but they taste amazing right out of the oven. A Danish birthday is also not complete without a bunch of Danish flags everywhere! Growing up with a mom who grew up in Denmark, all my birthday photos always had a Danish flag somewhere. † South Korea: ÎØ∏Ïó≠Íµ≠ Unlike the first two, Koreans' traditional birthday food is not a baked good, but instead is actually soup. On the day of their birthday, Koreans are often made seaweed soup to drink. This soup is actually in celebration of one's mother because Korean mothers often drink this after giving birth. The soup is full of nutrients that will make you healthy and strong. † China:†ÈïøÂØøÈù¢ In China, longevity noodles are eaten in hopes of a long life to come ahead of you. The dish is essentially just noodles in a chicken broth with an egg. The noodles symbolize your life so one should never cut them as it would then represent cutting your lifespan short. In Chinese culture, many foods come with superstitions just like these noodles.  † Mexico: Arroz con Leche At Mexican birthdays celebrations, it is a tradition to serve a type of rice pudding. This dessert can either be served hot or warm and is a must at celebrations. Along with hitting a pi√±ata on your special day, your birthday wouldn't be complete if this dish wasn't there.  † Australia: Fairy Bread Nothing sounds cooler than eating Fairy Breadù on your birthday, and that's exactly what Australians do. It's a quite simple dish made up of buttered bread with sprinkles all over but it has won the hearts of children all over Australia. Not only will they eat something sweet but they sure will have a sugar rush later to keep them powering through their birthday.  † Everywhere is different when it comes to birthday traditions. However, there is one thing that's constant; food can always make people and their stomachs happy!

on-the-menu,Mexican Hot Chocolate the Millenial Way,17-Jan-19,12:24 AM,['Marilu Bedolla'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/mexican-hot-chocolate-the-millenial-way/,"Winter Quarter has begun and the drop in temperature calls for warm drinks all times of the day. Mexican hot chocolate is a cup of rich cinnamon and chocolate flavor, popular during the Day of the Dead and throughout las posadas among Hispanics living in the U.S. and Latin America. This hot chocolate is enjoyed on its own or paired with pan dulce, a type of Mexican sweet pastry or tamales. The drink is traditionally made with a solid tablet of chocolate, milk and a whisk, which is a timely process because the drink is only ready once the tablet is fully melted. This recipe replaces the whisk with a blender, shortens the time to prepare the drink and still gives you that same grandma-made flavor. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE Servings: 4 Time: 15 minutes † 4 cups of milk  1 Abuelita chocolate tablet In a medium pot on high heat, simmer two cups of milk and then remove from heat. Place Abuelita tablet in a blender, add the warm milk and blend until the chocolate is dissolved. In the meantime, bring the second two cups of milk to a simmer. Add the mixture from the blender to the pot and boil. Stir the pot with a whisk until the chocolate drink boils. Serve warm.

When the temperature drops and the rain clouds roll in, the best way to prepare yourself for a brisk bike ride to class is with a delicious, hot bowl of oatmeal. Here are three takes on this breakfast classic to keep you nice and warm for the winter months to come. Courtesy of pxhere.com Chocolate Peanut Butter Oats
Ω cup rolled oats
1 cup water
2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tbsp peanut butter
1 banana, sliced
Honey (as much as desired) In a small pot, bring 1 cup of water and Ω cup rolled oats to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cover until the oats absorb all of the liquid. Stir in cocoa powder and transfer to a bowl. Top with peanut butter, sliced banana and drizzled honey. Saut√©d Apple and Cinnamon Oatmeal
Ω cup rolled oats
1 cup water
1 apple, diced
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp butter
Chia seeds In a small pot, bring 1 cup of water and Ω cup rolled oats to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cover until the oats absorb all of the liquid. Melt the butter in a pan and saut√© the diced apples over medium heat until soft. Stir in the maple syrup and cinnamon to the oatmeal and transfer to a bowl. Top with cooked apples and chia seeds. Courtesy of maxpixel.net Steel Cut Oats with Berry Compote
Ω cup steel cut oats
1Ω cup water
2 tsp lemon juice
1 tbsp honey
Handful blueberries
Handful blackberries
Chia seeds In a small pot, bring 1Ω cup water and Ω cup steel cut oats to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover until all the liquid is absorbed. In a saucepan, cook lemon juice, honey and berries over medium heat until they have reduced down to a jam-like consistency. Pour berry compote over oats and top with chia seeds. Helpful Tips:
If you want your oatmeal a bit richer, make it with Ω cup water and Ω cup milk. Also, you'll want to make sure you turn the temperature pretty low while you're cooking the oats, they'll turn out far better than if you blast them on a high temperature. All three of these takes on oatmeal are perfect for gloomy mornings. Not only will they keep you nice and warm, but they'll provide you with the perfect amount of energy to make it through these cold and dreary Winter Quarter days.

on-the-menu,Eating in Europe on a College Budget,23-Jan-19,12:47 AM,['Rinah Anatalio'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/eating-in-europe-on-a-college-budget/,"Being able to travel during your college years is one of the best experiences that someone can have. Traveling can be really expensive, especially when you have a small budget and full itinerary. Here are some tips to make the most out of your trip without breaking your wallet. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Research the area you're staying in: Most European countries have specialty dishes that they are widely known for. Foods that are popular in your area will not be as expensive because they are more accessible. For example, seafood in a coastal city is cheaper and fresher than seafood from a town in the middle of the countryside. Also, some cultures have certain schedules that can affect restaurant and supermarket hours, like siestas in Spain and the observation of Sunday Mass in France. Although tipping is expected in America, cultures vary from place to place, so it is wise to research the norms of your destination. This is important because tipping or not tipping can be a sign of respect. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus TripAdvisor: Although Yelp is widely used in America, it is not as common outside of the country. Most countries use TripAdvisor for their food, attractions, and museums. TripAdvisor can provide the operation hours, photos, menus and telephone numbers of restaurants. By using TripAdvisor, you can compare restaurant prices to each other and budget each meal accordingly. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Eat locally: Utilize the smaller bakeries (especially in France!) and supermarkets that are around you. Many small businesses rely on tourism as the main source of income and are often cheaper than the larger grocery chains. Buying a fresh baguette will last you a few days and can be used in a multitude of ways. Some places also have small farmers markets or seasonal markets that are affordable and ideal for trying new cultural dishes. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Bring your own: Tourist attractions overcharge on water, snacks and other necessities you need for a day out. By bringing your own water and snacks, you're able to save money and ensure the quality of the food. Also, food on the airplane is not the most ideal, so I highly recommend bringing your own food on the airplane, especially if you have dietary restrictions or food allergies. I have some food allergies myself, and my favorite snacks to bring on planes are instant oatmeal packets and dried fruit. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus

on-the-menu,California Tacos and Taproom: A Promising New Spot for Taco Tuesday in IV,24-Jan-19,12:00 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/california-tacos-and-taproom-a-promising-new-spot-for-taco-tuesday-in-iv/,"California Tacos and Taproom recently opened its doors in Isla Vista, offering yet another option to satisfy the community's love for Mexican food. The restaurant is centrally located on the corner of Seville, right next to Isla Vista Theatre. My friend and I chose to give it a try one afternoon, and grabbed a quick bite between classes. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus We walked past a spacious outdoor seating area furnished with high tables, large TVs and a long bar with several beers on tap before making it inside. The restaurant features another small seating area indoors next to the walk-up counter for ordering. It surprised me how quiet and empty it was at first, but that's most likely due to the time of day. In looking at the menu, we were pleasantly surprised to find a wide variety of Mexican food options. Beyond tacos, they offered a full breakfast menu, including chilaquiles, morning nachos, tostadas, taco salads, fajita/rice bowls, burritos and even desserts. They also did a great job of providing a large amount of vegan and vegetarian options on their menu, including a vegan rice bowl, vegan tacos, veggie burritos and more. Although everything looked enticing, we both felt obligated to try their tacos. The tacos can be ordered in unlimited amounts, but I instead chose to buy two of their vegan ones, priced at $4.00 each. Each came with a corn tortilla, bell peppers, onions, rice, lettuce, Peruvian beans, cilantro, green salsa and, of course, guacamole. I was very happy to find that they were generous with the guac and that the bell peppers were perfectly grilled without tasting too greasy. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus My friend chose to order one chicken and one chorizo taco, which came with a side of onions and green salsa. He told me they both were great, but if he had to choose his favorite, it would be the chorizo because it had just a bit more flavor and paired great with his tasty green salsa. What really stuck out in our experience was the fact that they managed to make the food decently priced and great tasting, but didn't end up leaving us with that heavy, bloated feeling usually associated with indulging in tacos. We could tell the food was made fresh and the quick service won us over even further. Overall, this new addition to the list of food joints in Isla Vista provides a comfortable, casual setting alongside delicious food. It's the perfect place for watching a big game with friends, picking up a quick meal on the go or feeding those pesky late night cravings î considering it's open until 2 a.m. Next time the Freebirds line is trailing out the door or you're looking to save a few bucks, I recommend giving California Tacos and Taproom a try!
Print Vegas tacos for $4 each?  That's pretty expensive for college kids. Pretty sure they are only open only until 10pm weekdays and midnight weekends. They suck!!

on-the-menu,You Want a Pizza These Three Tasty Recipes?,31-Jan-19,12:31 AM,['Laura Tucker'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/you-want-a-pizza-these-three-tasty-recipes/,"If there's one thing that can truly bring people from all walks of life together, it's pizza. Although our beautiful little town of Isla Vista comes equipped with three restaurants devoted to pizza, wouldn't it be nice to spare yourself the bill and make a delicious pie yourself? After all, pizza just so happens to be made of three of the cheapest ingredients out there: bread, tomatoes and cheese! Now, if you don't consider yourself much of a genius in the kitchen, you can always opt for the Trader Joe's pre-made pizza dough (I would recommend the garlic and herbs one, it's amazing). But if you want the real Italian pizza experience, you're going to have to put on your apron and get your hands a little dirty. Making your own pizza crust is actually very simple! It only takes a bit of warm water, yeast, flour and salt! Courtesy of pixabay.com Pizza Dough Ingredients:
1 cup warm (but not hot) water
Roughly 3 cups of flour (add more if needed)
1 packet yeast
1 tsp salt
Optional: 1 tsp sugar (will increase yeast activity) Directions:
Gently stir 1 packet of yeast (and sugar, if using) into warm water and let proof for 10 minutes (the mixture should look foamy when done). Add salt and flour, folding in with a wooden spoon. The dough should form a sticky ball that can still easily pull away from the bowl. Once the flour is incorporated, knead the dough for about 2 minutes and place in a bowl covered with a tea towel to rise. For best results, let the dough rise on the counter for an hour then move to the fridge overnight (if you don't have the time, just let the dough rise for about an hour before using it). This classic dough recipe will work for just about any pizza, but here are three delicious combinations to get you started! Margherita Pizza Ingredients:
Pizza dough (store bought or homemade)
Pizza sauce (Trader Joe's brand is awesome)
Fresh mozzarella cheese
Fresh basil Directions:
Place a pizza stone in oven and preheat to the highest setting; let the oven heat up for at least an hour. Stretch out pizza dough to desired thickness î I think it's best when it's stretched pretty thin, the crust gets beautifully crispy î and spread a light amount of sauce around the dough, leaving about an inch on the edges for the crust. Place a few torn pieces of mozzarella on top and throw in the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, taking the pie out halfway to put the fresh basil on. Spinach Artichoke Pizza Ingredients:
Pizza dough
Pizza sauce
Fresh mozzarella or ricotta
Canned artichoke hearts
Fresh spinach
Directions:
Place a pizza stone in oven and preheat to the highest setting and let the oven heat up for at least an hour. Stretch out pizza dough to desired thickness and spoon on sauce. Place some torn mozzarella, artichokes and spinach as desired, and bake for about 10 minutes or until golden brown. Sauceless Garlic Pizza Ingredients:
Pizza dough
Olive oil
Fresh mozzarella
Halved garlic cloves (however many you want)
Spinach Directions:
Place a pizza stone in oven and preheat to the highest setting; let the oven heat up for at least an hour. While the oven is preheating, saut√© a few halved garlic cloves in a bit of olive oil until they have a nice golden tint to them. Stretch out pizza dough to desired thickness and drizzle olive oil all over, as if it were sauce. Spread mozzarella across pizza and top with some spinach leaves and the saut√©d garlic cloves. Bake for about 10 minutes. **I would definitely recommend the margherita pizza over the others î it's a classic. It's always best to preheat a pizza stone (or cast iron skillet, pizza pan or regular cookie sheet) in the oven before throwing your pizza in, it helps get the bottom of the crust perfectly crispy. Also, if you're looking for a fancy alternative to fresh mozzarella, I would highly recommend using burrata î it's like a creamier version of mozzarella (who knew that was even possible?!). Alternatively, if you're looking for a less lactose-heavy version of these pizzas, simply substitute the mozzarella for some feta!

on-the-menu,Change Your Lifestyle: Six Reasons to Cut Out Meat in 2019,31-Jan-19,12:34 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/change-your-lifestyle-six-reasons-to-cut-out-meat-in-2019/,"As we enter the New Year, you may be looking to set some sort of resolution for 2019. Whether it's improving your health, saving the environment or even crossing something off your bucket list, the New Year is always a great opportunity to set a new goal. If you're looking to tackle a resolution this year that only requires a slight change to your diet but comes with many benefits, then I challenge you to look into going vegetarian. Here are six reasons why you should reduce or completely cut out meat from your diet in 2019. Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus 1. Improve your health
It is widely known that decreasing your meat consumption can improve your health in a variety of ways. Switching to a meatless diet is proven to reduce the chance of developing Type 2 Diabetes, lower cholesterol, decrease the risk of cancer, reverse heart disease and lengthen your lifespan (along with many others). Along with these extensive benefits, becoming vegetarian also helps you find more balanced sources of protein. Many people who eat meat regularly are consuming too much protein and exceeding their daily needs, which has been proven to lead to obesity. 2. Help the environment
One of the least talked about downsides of the meat industry is the drastic effects it has on our environment. Vast amounts of water, food and land resources are depleted in order to care for livestock. According to Food Tank, in order to produce just one pound of ground beef, it takes 1,799 gallons of water. As a comparison, soybeans only need about 576 gallons of water. In addition, mass deforestation has become a major issue linked to factory farms. These harmful actions î along with usage of manure and fertilizers î has resulted in massive amounts of carbon dioxide being released into the air, therefore further accelerating the effects of global warming. Lastly, the meat industry's inability to properly dispose of cow waste has caused pollution in neighboring water sources. This wastewater then gets carried in precipitation runoff to major bodies of water, predominantly the ocean, where it kills helpful plant and animal life. 3. Stand up against the dark side of the meat industry
While we all hope for an ideal scenario where the chicken, cow or pig on our plates come from a peaceful family farm, this is often not the reality. Factory farming is much more profitable in the eye of corporations, meaning companies are willing to house animals in filthy, cruel conditions. The unsanitary conditions under which these animals are housed compromise the integrity of the meat. Young livestock are often injected with hormones and antibiotics that make them grow faster and larger so that companies can exponentially increase the amount of meat produced. The faster they grow, the more meat that can be utilized after slaughter. The high doses of estrogen and other chemicals that are pumped into livestock can have drastic effects on our health. In simply going vegetarian, you can know for certain that your food comes from a natural, humane source. 4. Saving money
There is often a misconception that going vegetarian means more expensive grocery trips, when in reality it is the exact opposite. A shopping cart full of produce ultimately adds up to a lot less than one filled with meat. Grocers and markets can easily bump up prices of certain meats just by labeling them organic.ù A pound of meat also goes bad a lot faster than a pound of beans would, therefore making vegetarianism the more cost-effective and time-efficient choice in the long run. 5. Ending world hunger
As devastating as it is, many countries today struggle with extreme hunger, but it is not from a lack of resources. Food scarcity is not the issue causing world hunger; we have enough land to produce crops that could feed the entire world's population. However, food is being mass produced only to be given to livestock instead. This process has put third world countries in a never-ending cycle of hunger, since they cannot afford to eat the livestock our crops feed as it is so overpriced. Simply put, the more people who continue to eat meat on this planet, the more people that will go hungry. If less of the world's produce went to livestock, more of it would go to people. 6. The animals!
This is perhaps the most obvious reason for avoiding meat, but it still deserves to be emphasized. The best way to decrease animal cruelty is by adopting a vegetarian or nearly vegetarian diet. Although not all meat sources come from inhumane mechanisms, there are still many that do. This small change in diet has the ultimate power to decide whether an animal lives or dies. Whether you're just looking to try out a lifestyle change this year, or wanting to dive head-first into a vegetarian diet, cutting down your meat consumption comes with so many benefits and hopefully at least one stands out to you. It is important to remember that our protein sources aren't limited to meat î nuts, seeds, lentils, beans, oats, quinoa, broccoli and brussel sprouts are just a few examples of plant-based foods that are jam-packed with protein. If going vegetarian seems daunting right now, maybe try doing a meatless monday or dedicate one day a week to eating completely meat-free, then work up from there. A step as small as deciding to order a veggie burger instead of a beef patty makes a significant impact on your health, the environment, your budget and much more!

Although I'd much rather eat the food, I was very impressed by this interactive pop-up museum. Located in Pasadena, Calif., The Foodie Space features a large variety of food-themed exhibits created by local artists. The museum is closing its doors soon, so be sure to visit by Feb. 17! I stumbled across The Foodie Space while scrolling through Instagram and I knew I just had to visit it.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I went with a few of my friends and we found that it was actually really easy to take photos since there wasn't a large crowd and the museum had multiple rooms and each exhibit was nicely lit. The museum also has employees monitoring the exhibits and they were happy to take group photos for us. I enjoyed all the exhibits at The Foodie Space, but here are some of the ones that I especially liked! † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Sushi Platter This is the first exhibit that caught my eye when I walked into the museum. The yin and yang sign and the bamboo mat give the exhibit a cute Japanese vibe, but the real treat was the sushi plate. It had three colorful rolls, a pair of chopsticks and a sauce dish with wasabi. This exhibit was super fun to interact with because the sushi rolls were an easy prop to pose with for my photos. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Bowl of Pho The bowl of pho is probably the most popular exhibit on social media. The exhibit features a bowl of pho noodles (obviously) with lime and other vegetables, a huge sriracha bottle and even a jar of hoisin sauce! This exhibit has a bunch of props to play with, so it's perfect for both individual photos and group ones too. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Tea Cups The tea cup exhibit was not very well-lit, but I can let it slide because of how cute it was. The exhibit has two floral tea cups arranged in a Japanese-style tea ceremony setting. We were told we couldn't sit inside the tea cups, which was a bummer, but it was just as fun to interact with the huge tea bags that were inside the cups. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The Breakfast Club My friends and I spent eggs-traù long at this exhibit just because of how many different elements there were! It had rugs and pillows that looked like sunny-side-up eggs, an entire wall decked out with little fried egg decorations and an egg-themed DJ booth. This was my favorite exhibit because of how cute it was. † Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Fries Before Guys This exhibit is one of the larger ones. It's set up as a huge wedding chapel and at the altar there's a huge sculpture of french fries where you can take pictures as if you were getting married to the fries! I thought the photos were cute at the altar, but it was difficult to incorporate all the rows of the wedding chapel in our photos.  † Since I'm from Los Angeles, I've been to a lot of pop-up museums solely meant for taking photos, but The Foodie Space is my favorite by far. I'm a huge foodie and seeing some of my favorite foods blown out of proportion and being able to interact with them was a super fun experience. I'd definitely recommend checking it out, and since Valentine's Day is coming up, it'd be a great place to visit if your significant other is a foodie like me!

The producer and chef, Rei, made one of her favorite Japanese foods, okonomiyaki. Okonomiyaki is a Japanese savory pancake that contains a variety of ingredients depending on the region where it's made. The dish's name comes from the conjunction of the words okonomi, meaning what you like,ù and yaki, meaning cooked.ù In the video, the pancake was made with a tempura batter, cabbage, bean sprouts, scallions, pork belly slices, eggs and yakisoba noodles. All the ingredients were layered on top of each other and flipped at the very end, before being topped with mayonnaise and nori flakes. After watching this video, I knew I had to try it, but I knew making it at home would require a lot of practice and I simply didn't have time for that. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus So instead of making it myself, I found a restaurant in Los Angeles that specializes in okonomiyaki. Chinchikurin serves up Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki in Little Tokyo and Westwood and I couldn't wait to try it. I got there as soon as it opened for lunch and sat at the bar to watch the chefs construct my dish. Their okonomiyaki consists of 11 layers and it was made with similar ingredients to the ones used in the Tasty video. I ordered the Broc N' Shrimp,ù which is the classic okonomiyaki topped with sauteed broccoli and shrimp. I also had a choice between soft and crunchy noodles, and I chose crunchy because I wanted the texture variation. The okonomiyaki was served to me right off the grill and came with a handy metal spatula so that I could cut the pancake into bite-sized pieces. When I took my first bite, I instantly fell in love. The savory, umami flavors and the contrasting textures of the noodles, egg and cabbage worked in harmony to form the perfect bite. I found myself adding more japanese mayo to my okonomiyaki because the creamy sauce paired so well with it, and I just found myself eating more and more until there was nothing left on the plate. I'm glad I stumbled upon the video and learned about this amazing cultural dish. I'd definitely go back to Chinchikurin to try out the different menu items, as they offer a lot of different meat and vegetable variations for their okonomiyaki. Hopefully, I'll get to go back soon, but if not, I guess I'll have to start learning how to flip a an okonomiyaki pancake!

on-the-menu,Dip into Tsukemen Ramen,6-Feb-19,12:00 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/dip-into-tsukemen-ramen/,"There's nothing better than a hot, savory bowl of ramen when the weather becomes gloomy, but have you ever heard of cold ramen dipping noodles? The main difference between normal ramen and tsukemen is that for tsukemen, the noodles and soup are served separately while the noodles are served in the soup for regular ramen. Tsukemen is typically eaten by dipping the cold noodles into the hot soup, but there are variations in which the noodles are warm too! This dish was invented in 1861 in Tokyo and spread throughout the country. In the United States, however, tsukemen is pretty uncommon except in Los Angeles. I'm from Los Angeles, and whenever I visit Japantown, I always see a mob of people waiting outside a ramen restaurant, Tsujita L.A. Artisan Noodle. I finally decided to try it and called ahead to find out when the restaurant has the shortest waiting time. I arrived around 4 p.m. on a weekend and I still had to wait about 20 to 30 minutes before getting seated at the bar area. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I ordered the Cha Sui Tsukemen, which comes with cold dipping noodles topped with lime and slices of barbequed pork and hot dipping broth, which came with green onions, a soft-boiled egg and more pork meat. The restaurant came with cute flyers that had instructions on how to properly enjoy the dish, which I followed. I squeezed some lime on the noodles and dipped them in the broth. Then, I slurped it up and tried some of the savory pieces of meat. At first, it was weird to taste the cold noodles and the hot soup together, but I got used to it and the contrasting temperatures made the dish more flavorful. I also liked the slices of cha siu, but since there was already pork inside the dipping broth, I would just order the dish without it since it is pretty pricey.  I also tried adding a scoop of karashi takana, spicy pickled greens, for an extra kick. After I finished the noodles, a waiter came and poured a light broth into my dipping broth since the dipping broth is too thick to drink by itself. My stomach was completely full after this meal and the wait was definitely worth it. Overall, the tsukemen was really tasty and it was a fun experience! It's definitely worth making the drive down to L.A.!

Additionally, deciding on the perfect mixture of affordable, healthy and delicious becomes more difficult when the real world truly hits and we're faced with the problems of time management and financial responsibility. Thankfully, Health & Wellness hosted a workshop at the Tenaya Market, conveniently located in the San Joaquin Villages, which featured a quick tutorial on how to make healthy and affordable snacks for us college students making the transition to adulthood. The event was called New Year, New Snacksù and was held on Jan. 31. It was thrown by UCSB's Health & Wellness department, and they were generous enough to give us three quick granola bar recipes and samples to try. Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus These are my personal opinions on each bar: No-Bake
This one was my personal favorite. The texture was consistent and chewy throughout. Furthermore, it's the quickest to make, considering the lack of baking, and its ingredients were the easiest and most fun to substitute for different flavors. Oats & Honey
The oats and honey bar was my second favorite of the three. The only reason it wasn't my favorite was simply because the sample offered was a little crumbly. However, the recipe can't be blamed for the bar being crumbly. I was told that it could've been baked longer, and the oats used were gluten free. Normal oats and a longer baking time would've made it the perfect granola bar. Add in some chocolate chips, and it would've tasted exactly like a Quaker Chewy Granola Bar. Cherry & Almonds
This one was great, but I wouldn't have minded if I didn't get to try it out. I can see how people like it, but I personally found it too salty. It could do with some unsalted almonds or even just a change in the type of nut used. The almonds were too crunchy and ruined the consistency of each bite. This was noticeable when a bite had both dried fruits and almonds. I had to continue to chew the almonds for quite some time after I had already chewed every other part of said bite. Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Furthermore, the staff had said the ingredients are substitutable! As long as the same ingredient conditions are met, the recipe can be changed to make the granola savory, spicy or whatever other flavor you're craving. The interchangeability adds an exciting new dimension to these delicious snacks and gives us the opportunity to make it healthier or to accommodate food allergies. You can even add in protein powders! Overall I found the New Year, New Snacksù event to be helpful. Adulting is difficult as is, and Health & Wellness was considerate enough to provide us with quick, affordable and tasty recipes. I would definitely continue to keep an eye out for more of their food events because they're useful, and I'll personally take all the help I can get.

When it comes to Chinese New Year, there are certain dishes that are eaten for their symbolism. These traditional lucky foodsù were chosen based on their appearance and pronunciation in the Chinese language. Not only that, but the way these foods are eaten and prepared also signify how the upcoming year will go. Photo courtesy of Flickr.com Fish  Steamed fish is a common dish you'll find at any New Year's Eve celebration dinner. as †it sounds like the word surplusù in Chinese. Because it is meant to signify hope for a surplus amount of money saved, the fish is meant to be eaten last î also, you should always have a bounty of leftovers. How the fish is placed on the table also has a symbolic meaning. Dumplings Growing up in a Chinese household, I remember having to make lucky dumplings on New Year's Eve. They are meant to represent wealth, as they are shaped like Chinese silver ingots. I would always be told that the more dumplings I ate, the wealthier I would become in the new year. Glutinous Rice Cakes This has to be by far my favorite dish to eat during the New Year. My grandma would always make batches and batches of these and her kitchen would be filled with the smell of rice cakes. This dish is supposed to represent a more productive new year with a better income and employment position. Eating this is supposed to improve your overall quality of life throughout the new year. Sweet Rice Balls This dessert dish represents togetherness and reunion due to the round shape of the balls. I would say this dish is a crowd favorite î it's a nice, sweet end to the celebration that only puts smiles on people's faces. Noodles Longevity noodles are a common dish in almost any Chinese celebration as they symbolize a long and healthy life. Their length represents the eater's life, so make sure to never cut these noodles. Fruit Fruits like tangerines or oranges are often eaten during the Chinese New Year as they're chosen for their round, gold-ish appearance. They are supposed to bring good fortune, luck and fullness.  Sweets One of the best parts of the Chinese New Year always ends up being the sweets most Chinese families dole out. Any given party will always had an assortment of sweets packed into a golden and/or red package. Eating sugary foods signifies a sweet start to the new year. They usually come in the form of candied fruits and vegetables, like lotus roots, coconut strips, coconut wedges, winter melons, kumquats and water chestnuts.

Because of this and the busyness of midterm season, meal prepping baked goods has become my go-to. One of my favorite things to eat during any time of the day and anywhere on campus is muffins. They are easily transportable and you can eat them super quietly, which is perfect for an all-nighter in Davidson or that lunchtime lecture that drags on forever.
These muffins are gluten-free and packed with protein because of the addition of Greek yogurt. My personal favorite is the white chocolate raspberry because they look and taste so good!

The recipe below will yield about two bowls of soup, but feel free to just increase the amounts of each ingredient to make a bigger batch.  Laura Tucker / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Steps: This soup is insanely delicious, but make sure you don't let it simmer for too long or your vegetables will get too soft! Also, feel free to substitute the spinach for kale, it's a bit of a sturdier green and would go really well with the other veggies. If you want to save yourself from washing an extra dish, brown the onions in the pot and simply pour the broth and spices over them.

After nearly two decades of believing coffee could stunt my growth, science has shown that my mom was wrong all along. What I tell patients is, if you like coffee,ù Dr. Peter Martin, the director of the Institute for Coffee Studies at Vanderbilt University, says, go ahead and drink as much as you want and can.ù Research has consistently proven the health benefits of coffee î its caffeine content improves focus, increases metabolism and has powerful antioxidant effects on drinkers. As an avid coffee drinker myself, I am at times baffled by those who refuse to drink it. My roommate, for one, often can't stand the taste and complains of stomach upset. Another friend of mine says she wishes she could drink coffee but finds the beverage anxiety-inducing. Luckily, for those who can't stomach coffee, either out of dislike for the taste or how it digests, there are a handful of coffee alternatives to still reap the benefits of caffeine: Image courtesy of medicalnewstoday.com 1. Black Tea I used to think the caffeine content in tea was hokey-pokey, but it turns out I had been drinking the wrong variety: Green tea, with a modest 35 mg of caffeine, tends not to be very stimulating, whereas black tea, averaging 50 mg. of caffeine, is more comparable to a cup of coffee. (For reference, 8 oz of black coffee contains 100 mg of caffeine). Like coffee, black tea is also the holder of numerous health benefits î researchers boast of its antioxidant properties and its ability to improve cholesterol, blood pressure and even gut health. My roommate, who is plagued with stomach upset upon drinking coffee, is a huge proponent of tea. It's a nice rise in energy,ù she confided to me. It doesn't make me feel nervous; it's a pleasant, slow energy boost.ù For those who are similarly caffeine-sensitive, black teas are a cheap and gentle option for a morning pick-me-up. † Recommended for: Caffeine-sensitive students, students on a budget
Pros: Lightly stimulating, provides a steady release of energy
Cons: Not as strong as traditional coffee
Rating: 3/5 stars Image courtesy of amazon.com 2. Bulletproof Coffee Technically speaking, bulletproof coffee is not that different from your regular cup of joe, but its additives, unsalted butter and MCT oil, provide an extra kick for those looking to prolong their caffeine hit without drinking an excessive amount. The combination of caffeine and fats [fuel] the body,ù says HuffPost nutritionist, Fiona Tuck. Naturally, bulletproof coffee is high-calorie and high-fat, serving as a meal replacement and sustaining energy levels throughout the day. Curious, I purchased two bottles of premade bulletproof coffee for my roommate and me. I downed a quarter of the bottle; my roommate didn't even swallow. We were both immediately sick to our stomachs. Upon further research, this is a common reaction to novice bulletproof coffee drinkers, A high fat intake at breakfast may cause stomach upset in some individuals,ù HuffPost's Juliette Steen writes, and medium-chain fats, like the ones included in MCT oil, tend to have a bitter taste. A quick google search confirmed that the MCT oil in bulletproof coffee, for many, is an acquired taste: Bulletproof Coffee Taste Like Shit?ù one forum ventures. I just made bulletproof coffee; never again,ù another reads. For those who don't have time to eat breakfast and need a longer energy boost, bulletproof coffee is a viable option, but I don't recommend it for the faint of heart. † Recommended for: Busy students
Pros: Convenient meal replacement, long-lasting energy
Cons: Taste is questionable
Rating: 2/5 stars Image courtesy of gooddaychocolate.com 3. Caffeinated Chocolate Good Day Chocolate is a candy brand that produces chocolate-flavored supplements, with their line of Energy Chocolates being one of its most popular varieties. As its name denotes, it consists of caffeinated chocolate candies, intended to provide a sweet energy boost. Chocolate is one of the most effective delivery systems for [caffeine],ù its website boasts, and it provides a kick equivalent to that of a cup of coffee. It looks like an orange M&M,ù my roommate remarked. We both tried a piece. It tasted like an M&M as well: dangerously snackable. A serving of Energy Chocolate is four pieces, but I, a chocoholic with no impulse control, ended up eating the entire box. I lay in bed later that night with a racing heart, unable to sleep. As an energy supplement, I found it extremely effective (and delicious); purchase at your own risk. † Recommended for: Sweet tooths
Pros: Travel-friendly, effective energy boost, tastes like candy
Cons: Tastes like candy
Rating: 4/5 stars Image courtesy of usatoday.com 4. Kombucha Kombucha is a fermented variety of tea, containing colonies of live bacteria. Often carbonated, the health benefits of kombucha as a probiotic have been widely publicized, backed by claims that it improves digestion and immunity in addition to being a plentiful source of vitamins and enzymes.  In terms of palette, many find the taste of kombucha objectionable. HuffPost's Rebecca Orchant once quipped that kombucha tastes like vinegary sodaù; my roommate feels similarly. For the most part, she tells me, it's acidic in taste, and due to its image as a premium health food, it also tends to be expensive. Depending on the brand, a bottle can retail for up to 10 dollars.  As kombucha is brewed from tea, it does, to a lesser extent, contain caffeine. A cup of coffee is roughly four times as effective. The energy boost is subtle, but palpable, and recommended for those seeking probiotic benefits from their morning brew. † Recommended for: Health-conscious students Pros: Probiotic and immune system benefits Cons: Not as strong as traditional coffee, pricey, questionable taste Rating: 2/5 stars Image courtesy of morrisdistributing.com 5. Yerba Mate And, of course, how could anyone forget yerba, the HG stimulant for studying college students? Yerba mate is a type of herbal tea, often compared to coffee in terms of caffeine content. Flush with antioxidants and boasting an impressive 80 mg. of caffeine per serving, the tea is known for its health and energy-inducing properties that give a more mellow buzz than other energy drinks. My sister, who introduced me to yerba, concurs: It's not like Red Bull. Red Bull makes me jittery,ù she says. It's just so nice and clean.ù She recommends it as an alternative for those who are particularly caffeine-sensitive.  Yerba mate can be brewed at home, but the Guayaki brand in particular offers a wide, 16-flavor selection, available at UCSB's Arbor. Personally, I'm partial to the Pomegranate flavor, but that's just me. † Recommended for: Caffeine-sensitive students Pros: Steady release of energy Cons: N/A Rating: 5/5 stars Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,Goleta Farmer's Market Brings Joy to the Community,21-Feb-19,12:16 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/goleta-farmers-market-brings-joy-to-the-community/,"With the recent gloomy weather, it can sometimes be difficult to make that trip to the grocery store î or let alone even step outside. Last weekend, I was struggling with this exact issue before stumbling across one of Goleta's hidden gems, which managed to make the weather seem at least a little less unpleasant. Every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the Camino Real Marketplace hosts one of Santa Barbara's certified farmers markets, along with live music for all of the shopping center's customers to enjoy! Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus There was something about the sense of community and joy that radiated from the farmers market that morning immediately drew me in. Families could be seen walking the aisle of booths owned by many local farmers, while children danced along to the sound of a local band performing in the courtyard. Each seller greeted me with a smile and occasionally offered me a taste of their most popular item. Many of the tents that lined the market offered a wide selection of local produce, including fresh berries, oranges, avocados, vegetables and more. Others included organically sourced meats, eggs, honey, nuts and dried fruits. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus My favorite purchase from the market was from Baba Small Batch Hummus. They were selling six different variations of hummus, including flavors like red pepper, avocado and cilantro, roasted garlic and artichoke, sun-dried tomato basil and cilantro jalapeno. There were also booths with locally grown, non-edible items. One in particular was a table covered in different candles that were each made entirely from beeswax. Another one included a variety of homemade essential oils, and the woman working the booth was happy to tell me about the individual benefits of each one. In walking just a little further down, I could see many locally grown flowers and succulents. My heart just about melted when I witnessed a man in front of me buy a large bouquet for his wife. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus After walking around for over 30 minutes, enraptured by the cheerful era of the farmers market, I headed home with my arms full of fresh veggies and my spirits lifted. While Sunday mornings can be busy and stressful, I definitely recommend taking the time to visit the Goleta Farmer's Market to walk around, enjoy the music and support our local farmers!

on-the-menu,Hot or Not and How Hot,27-Feb-19,12:25 AM,['Shelby Guy'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-27/hot-or-not-and-how-hot/," Coffee: it's an essential and sometimes necessary part of many college students' daily lives. As someone who usually sticks to drinking strictly tea (no offense), I've always wanted to know what makes coffee better and how to make it best. Because of this, I've decided to test some theories with an experiment.  Courtesy of pixabay.com The Experiment: The amount/type of coffee grounds and brew time were kept consistent throughout the experiment; only the temperature was altered. I gathered some coffee experts to test different brew temperatures and asked them to then give us their opinion. † The Results: I started this experiment by brewing the coffee at the highest temperature we could safely manage. The experts agreed that this gave the coffee a slightly more pungent taste than they were used to, as the temperature of the water had most likely burned the beans, causing them to expel more tannins î a chemical compound found in caffeine. This gave the coffee a much more astringent taste. When compared to commercial brands in the current market, the experts found it most resembled a Starbucks Blonde Roast. This temperature was said to have the strongest coffee flavor of all, as it had a much more earthy taste and a fuller body than the others tested.  Next, I brewed the coffee at what would, for the most part, be considered a more acceptable temperature. The general consensus was that this coffee still tasted slightly acidic and contained a measurable degree of burnt flavor from the beans. This was, however, the least liked temperature, as it was the least interesting. The temperature neither added to the acidity î something many coffee drinkers enjoy î nor was it smooth enough to be enjoyable.  Our last cup of hot coffee went down easily, as the tasters agreed that it was by far the smoothest cup. The beans did not have as much of a chance to burn or give off a bitter aftertaste. The low temperature, however, did not allow the beans enough time to steep. This gave the coffee a rather flat taste and ended up being the tasters' least favorite. In the final, most complicated cup of coffee we made, we tested the ever-popular cold brew. This cup, according to the experts, was different than the others. It had lost almost all of its acidity but retained a much silkier aftertaste. The coffee itself was described as having a different texture entirely. The brewing process cost the coffee the majority of its kick, as it no longer had the characteristic roast that coffee is known for.

on-the-menu,I.V. Boba Tier List,28-Feb-19,12:03 AM,['Leonard Paulasa'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/i-v-boba-tier-list/,"What's boba and where did it come from? Simply put, boba is just the name for the tapioca pearls that add extra texture and flavor to your favorite bubble tea. The tea itself originated from Taiwan and is interchangeable, allowing for different variations in flavor, sweetness, taste and sometimes texture î completely up to preference. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Personally, I'm from the Bay and have been blessed with amazing teahouses like Teaspoon, Happy Lemon, GongCha, PlenTea and countless others that I can't even remember. But I can tell you what I do remember, and that's the excitement and joy I had when my friends and I tried as many different boba places as we could find in the Bay. It's been a long time debate amongst ourselves on which teahouse sold the best boba, and through this we finally agreed on the best Bay Area teahouse î it's Teaspoon, they use lactose free milk and the tapioca is perfect.  Unfortunately, I no longer have the luxury of having a car while living in I.V. and L.A. is too long a drive during the quickly passing quarter for multiple L.A. boba trips. I'm a third-year transfer, and like many other students I just stuck to the most recommended teahouse, Mojos, but it wasn't quite the same. It didn't give me the same satisfaction as the boba back home, so I set out and made it my goal to identify the best teahouse in I.V. so that students, past, present or future, won't be confused. So here it is, in order of best to worst. All the places î as far as I know î in I.V. that sell boba. The criteria was just regular Milk Tea with 100 percent sweetness and no ice, and to come up with their overall rankings I added the individual scores of the tea and tapioca, divided by cost before tax.  1) Naan Stop 2) Pho Bistro 3) Mojo's Teahouse 4) Hana Kitchen 5) Spudnuts 6 & 7) Fire & Ice or WakeCup In my honest opinion, anything after Hana really isn't worth it anymore. The rest are below mediocre in terms of quality, price or both. I recommend sticking to the top four, but I do have a few things you should consider: I hope this list helps past, present and future Gauchos alike, and maybe there's a hidden teahouse somewhere in I.V. I wasn't able to try. Teahouses seem to just pop up, and I recently read that Starbucks is starting to sell Bubble Tea, so who knows who truly holds No. 1.
Print You missed Sweet Alley's! Best milktea and boba imo Where's that Choppa Poke Boba It's not in IV Spudnuts? really? you forgot Wake Cup ì much better than the last two. WakeCup is on the list. Read the whole thing maybe.

Last week's cooking class was one of the many workshop classes provided by a program created as part of a larger initiative to help participants learn about meal-prepping and stretching the dollar, all while learning about mindful eating. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Last Tuesday's class was led by Edit Hosisminasians, third-year financial math and statistics major, who interns for the Food, Nutrition and Basic Skills program (FNBS). Hosisminasians said that the classes are made to benefit the participants. I think essentially to help out students that don't know how to necessar[ily] cook or shop on a budget, and it's difficult to have nutritious food for them at home because of it. So we really wanted to tackle that,ù Hosisminasians said. On the university's website, FNBS is described to have come together thanks to the partnership of the community, university programs and students. Also mentioned in the website was the program's purpose to reduce food insecurity for college students. Hosisminasians said that from pre-surveys and post-surveys participants fill out during the workshop, she has noticed participants are changing their eating habits. I don't have the numbers right now, but we noticed that it actually does help the students learn skills necessary to cook better or make better choices when they're eating and eat less processed foods,ù Hosisminasians said. The intern said that the program is developing and is expanding the services provided. It is basically about doing like a series of cooking classes,ù Hosisminasians said. So series one would be you would learn how to do like basic knife skills. The next one would be you would learn how to wash vegetables and produce and like how to shop.ù The intern said that people who complete the series of classes would receive a certificate of completion and the program would be free of cost for participants. The multipurpose room located inside the Student Resource Building î the space used to host the workshop î made use of the space and makeshift cooking stations, made up of a single pot burner and a cutting board. On the menu was a one-pot mac and cheese recipe that called for vegetable broth to boil and cook the pasta. Not much broth was used in the recipe, which allowed for the noodles to cook fast and capture the broth's flavor. For the recipe itself, students do not have to follow it strictly, as they can modify the quantity of ingredients. This mac and cheese called for three types of cheese and soy milk to create a white sauce for the pasta shells. The instructor told participants that the best time to add their vegetable toppings was after the cheese sauce was fully melted. This recipe is unique because it is loaded with vegetables, inclusive to people with dietary restrictions and satisfying. Students are able to sign up for these classes online through Health & Wellness or at the program's table before the workshop starts. For the full mac and cheese recipe, follow the ingredients and instructions below: Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Lunch/Dinner: ONE-POT MAC N CHEESE Servings: 4 Start to finish: 30 minutes Ingredients: Directions: Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,A Recipe for Success: Buddha Bowls Unveils a New Breakfast Menu,7-Mar-19,12:01 AM,['Tiffany Velazquez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/a-recipe-for-success-buddha-bowls-unveils-a-new-breakfast-menu/,"From the Mac Daddy to the New England Clam Chowder, Buddha Bowls has been serving their bread bowl creations to the community of Isla Vista since 2014. Offering both readily-prepared and build your own options, Buddha Bowls has decided to take the next natural step in their flavor journey by unveiling a breakfast menu. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus We reached out to the owner, Daniel Dunietz, after hearing about the new changes on Facebook, and he was kind enough to invite us to come in and try the food out. I stopped with a friend on Friday morning during the menu's inaugural week, whereupon Dan greeted us kindly. Preparing everything himself, Dan offered us one of everything on the breakfast menu to give us the full scope of things î bypassing the Breakfast Bowl so as not to overpower us with food right off the bat.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus We got started with the Avocado Toast, which was a step up from your run-of-the-mill toast with the addition of tomatoes, feta cheese and balsamic vinegar. While not normally a fan of avocado toast, I found the latter two ingredients really delivered that wow factor and gave it that extra burst of flavor. The bread itself held up well under the weight of the numerous wet ingredients and, all in all, we devoured it just a few bites. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Our next dish was the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Sandwich, featuring the added bonus of sausage, which would have otherwise cost extra. A savory and hearty bite, the sandwich was definitely a contender for our favorite. Well worth your buck, it's a big one and requires the use of both hands to truly get a grip on it. †Jam packed with both ingredients and flavor, the drizzle of pesto sauce helped it to stand out and easily beat the competition.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Arriving before the sandwich was even completed were the Hash Browns. The were loaded with cheese and bacon î another added bonus î and perfectly crisp. They had that highly desirable cheese pull when sinking our forks in. This was, unfortunately, the only dish we were unable to complete, as we opted to save room for dessert. The shining star of the day was, without a doubt, the Cinnamon Kush. A deeply spiritual experience, it somehow managed to be perfectly soft and fluffy without getting soggy. Composed of french toast with warm, gooey cinnamon icing and powdered sugar, it was the main event and I'm happy we saved it. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus As we finished up our food, Dan came over to sit with us and discuss his thoughts on how things seemed to be shaping up during the menu's first week. Happy to hear just how much we had enjoyed everything, he expressed how satisfied he was with the recent turn out. A little slow going at first, the arrival of the weekend appeared to be bringing in the morning rush. Curious as to what had brought about the addition of breakfast, Dan told us the idea had actually been essentially three years in the making. Having tried to incorporate breakfast during the restaurant's sophomore year, the menu items did not succeed as expected, and in fact, many customers actually seemed unaware that breakfast options were being offered at all. Dan has more hope for this go around, as he's remaining very involved and hands-on while the cooks get the hang of things. His only worry is the Cinnamon Kush, the only item that would not be able to be offered outside of the breakfast hours of 7 to 11 a.m., as the grill is overflowing with savory meats during that time for their traditional menu. After talking it over, we played with the idea of potentially serving it again after the day's dinner rush as a late night munchies option. So the next time you're craving Buddha Bowls, make sure you take the time to swing by in the morning. Don't be afraid to give your taste palate a change and try their Cinnamon Kush. Enjoy a little something sweet because whatever they're doing here, they should never stop!

Celiac disease is an allergy to gluten, a substance found in wheat (which means †gluten is basically in everything). I thought I would never be able to eat foods that I once enjoyed like donuts, pizza and chicken nuggets. Luckily, many gluten-free options are available in restaurants today. Unfortunately, some places either charge extra for gluten free substitutes or do not offer them at all. Since this allergy developed late in my life, I initially thought I could just suck it up and endure the stomach pain that gluten caused me. But most of the time, I know that it's not worth it and I try to create what I'm craving at home. I believe that food allergies should not stop anyone from enjoying foods that they love because there are always substitutions to be made and new things to try.

For me, I often forget to eat breakfast because I simply don't have the time to cook or I'm just too sleep-deprived to even drag myself to the kitchen. But luckily, after buying an entire box of butter croissants from Costco, I was inspired to start making breakfast again. This recipe is super simple and the only thing you really have to cook is a fried eggîwhat's easier than that?

You can make this croissant sandwich with tons of different varieties. I've tried it adding turkey meat and cheese, and honestly, it's the butter croissant that ties everything together.

on-the-menu,A Vegan Guide to Eating at the Happiest Place on Earth,12-Mar-19,11:13 PM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/a-vegan-guide-to-eating-at-the-happiest-place-on-earth/,"Nothing beats the undeniably alluring scent of cinnamon churros and buttery popcorn when entering through the gates of Disneyland. As someone living a plant-based lifestyle, the self-control needed to resist indulging in all of the famous Disneyland treats can seem impossible. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I didn't exactly have to give up everything I enjoyed eating in the park, even when I cut out dairy and eggs. Believe it or not, the park is filled with lots of vegan-friendly cuisine that doesn't disappoint. Through my personal experiences wandering the park and discovering new options, I have gathered a list of some of my favorite Disney hacks for eating plant-based î perfect for if you are living a specific lifestyle or just looking for some healthier options in the park! Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Disneyland Popcorn: I know it may be hard to believe, but yes, the irresistible Disneyland popcorn offered at multiple stands throughout the park is in fact vegan! When I first read about this †online, I doubted its legitimacy myself, but after speaking with workers in the park, I was informed that the buttery flavoring used is actually dairy-free. This had to be one of my favorite surprises after becoming plant-based.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Tiki Room Dole Whip: Another surprising addition to the park's vegan-friendly snacks is the famous Dole Whip soft-serve offered at the Tiki Stand in Adventureland. This refreshing dessert, along with the Dole Whip floats, provide a creamy and sweet option, without the dairy. I can personally attest that the long, winding line for these treats is always worth it, and they taste even better on a hot day. † Mickey Pretzel: The Mickey pretzel is another famous snack associated with the park. The dough is both egg and dairy-free, making it a great addition to this list. The only personal setback I have with the pretzel is that the original cheese dip that goes with it is obviously not vegan. Without any dip, it can be extremely dry. I suggest asking a nearby restaurant for some mustard or marinara sauce as an alternative.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Pickles: While I've heard this Disneyland classic is a hit or miss among park attenders, the famous pickles have always been a staple snack for me when I visit. While this is a more obvious vegan-friendly option, I felt it necessary to include just because of how good they are. The also come in spicy and sour flavors along with the original. † Fresh Fruit: This is a fairly obvious choice, but I still feel it deserves to be acknowledged! Among all the sugary treats and salty snacks, it can be nice to find a refreshing, healthy choice in the park to keep you going all day. Fruit stands can be found all around Disneyland, with options such as watermelon, apple and pineapple slices, or fresh grapes. Some specific locations include the gift shop in Adventureland near the Jungle Cruise exit, the cart overlooking Big Thunder Railroad in Adventureland, the stand just to the right of the Main Street entrance and the table in Tomorrowland right outside the Disney Vacation Club.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus The Jolly Holiday: If you're looking for more of a substantial meal, this welcoming restaurant is a classic choice. Located on the left side of the Main Street courtyard, this spot is known for its famous grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. After speaking with the workers, I found that the tomato soup is vegan if you ask for no parmesan shavings on top. Instead of ordering it with grilled cheese, I usually just ask for a cup of their tomato soup along with their grilled vegetables and whole grain salad. † Carnation Cafe: Carnation Cafe also sits in the heart of Main Street and has more of a formal sit-down restaurant setting. The chef's vegan burger is my favorite item on the menu and it includes a black bean patty, tomatoes, lettuce, pickled red onions and vegan chipotle mayonnaise. Many of the entree salads can also be made plant-based if you ask for no chicken or cheese and substitute the dressing for the balsamic vinaigrette. † Royal St. Veranta: This secluded walk-up counter is located in New Orleans Square just past the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The menu is limited to their two famous gumbos: steak and vegetarian. The vegetarian gumbo is also conveniently vegan and pairs perfectly with their sourdough bread bowls! † River Belle Terrace: This cute spot looks out upon the Rivers of America and offers their barbecue tofu as either a main dish with two sides or in a salad. The plant-based sides include tater tots or steamed vegetables. If you choose to order a salad, ask for their apple vinaigrette as a dairy-free option! † Rancho Del Zocalo: This happens to be my favorite restaurant in the park due to the sheer amount of plant-based options it offers. This walk-up Mexican restaurant sits just next to Big Thunder Railroad and comes with a courtyard overlooking Frontier Land. Their tostada salad is completely vegan when it's ordered fajita style, and it comes with grilled vegetables, guacamole, lettuce and refried beans. Another great option is their Soft Tacos Monterey,ù which can also be ordered fajita-style and without cheese. My personal favorite order is the Burrito Sonoraù ordered fajita-style, which comes with grilled vegetables, lettuce, rice and refried beans î just ask for it without cheese.  † While eating plant-based in Disneyland may require a little more thought ahead of time, it does not mean you have to miss out! As you may have noticed, many of the most popular park items happen to be vegan or can be made vegan when they are specially ordered. Next time you find yourself in Disneyland, hopefully you find these plant-based hacks useful in order to find some healthy options and vegan snacks!

I've always wanted to try the hot dogs here because of the fun combinations of hot dog toppings and the wide variety of savory bites. I finally got to visit last Friday, and though I expected there to be a lot of people, it wasn't very crowded and the employees were quick to take our order and serve us our food. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I ordered the Santa Barbara-style Hot Dog, which comes with bacon, grilled onions, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, cream sauce, avocado, cilantro and mustard. They have almost 20 different types of hot dogs, including a Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese Dog and a Taco Dog, which is what my friend ordered. Their hot dogs come with just a regular hot dog bun and beef sausage, but they have alternatives like veggie, turkey, polish, hot link or bratwurst sausages. The Santa Barbara-style Hot Dog was really savory, and each bite definitely packed a punch with all its delicious flavors. I especially liked that they didn't skimp out on any of the condiments, but it may have been a little too much since my hot dog bun broke halfway through and everything started to fall apart. Regardless, it was extremely tasty and I'd definitely recommend it.  † We also tried their fries, which were nicely crisp, making it the perfect addition to our meal. They have a bunch of different small bites and grub, like loaded tater tots, pizza fries, deep-fried pickles and corn on the cob, which I'd really like to try the next time I visit Dave's Dogs. Everything on the menu was reasonably priced, which is ideal for college students. Overall, this spot is definitely a must-try because you can't get anything like it in I.V., and it's the perfect place to relax and treat yourself to a quick and delicious meal.

The new addition mainly offers a large assortment of juices, soups and baked goods, in addition to salads and coffee. †The cafe also offers a variety of breakfast items, and the market aspect of the cafe provides additional snack and meal options î both helpful if customers don't have time to cook at home. † Emily Hannigan, marketing manager and chief consultant for all three restaurants, says that Sup & J√ºs was created and inspired from the concept of a Barcelona market, when the husband and wife owners were walking through the streets of Barcelona and Paris.  † Hannigan said that Jay [Ferrero], owner of S√ºp & J√ºs, tried all the soups and had spent years finalizing them. She says that customers can expect S√ºp & J√ºs to use local and high quality meats, cheeses or any other ingredients for their soups, salads and sandwiches. She explained that soup options vary each week depending on what ingredients are in season from their delivery service. She added that the bread they use is an artisan bread from La Brea Bakery.  † For the juices as well, all the fresh produce, you know we're sourcing it from The Berry Man here locally which is from the local farms in town,ù Hanningan said. † S√ºp & J√ºs is located inside Kyle's Kitchen at Hollister Village Plaza in Goleta. † The cafe offers breakfast, lunch and dinner food options that can either be packaged or served for a sit-in meal at their tables or patio. The space inside has Spanish tile flooring, large white walls and is decorated with one large colorful splash image of fresh juices at an unmanned marketplace. † Sup & J√ºs invited two reporters to sample the menu and below is a description of some of their featured food items: Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Salads Kale Walnut and Cranberry Salad Labeled as gluten-free, dairy-free and vegan, Hannigan says that this is the super food salad out of the three offered salads on the visit. The salad is a kale leaf salad coated with a tangy cranberry vinaigrette. The cranberry vinaigrette is not overpowering in terms of a tangy taste. Instead it enhances the bite of walnuts, quinoa and organic carrot slices. Also, the cranberry vinaigrette does not dampen the ingredients because the kale and walnuts remain crunchy. This salad balances the size of the kale and amount of quinoa present in every bite and is enjoyable due to the different textures packed in the salad. † † Vegan Buddha Bowl This salad is a vegan take on the buddha bowl. It removes the poke and adds a colorful assessment of ingredients that make a tasty salad. This buddha bowl uses kale as its greens, and is wonderfully complemented by some quinoa, red peppers, squash and grilled zucchini. The roasted broccoli and the crispiness of the chickpeas integrate properly with the rest of the salad to create a wonderful texture in each bite. However, what really ties this salad together is the Tahini vinaigrette, made by Hannigan herself. All the ingredients mix into one delicate dish that proves healthy food can be delicious. Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Soups Turkey Sausage and Kale Soup Hannigan said the turkey sausage and kale soup is one of the lighter soups, compared to the heartier soups. The soup is a hot bowl of a bite of ground smokey and savory ground turkey accompanied with soft beans. Floating in the broath are soft kale leaves, bits of tomatoes and diced carrots.  † Chicken Tortilla Sup and J√ºs' chicken tortilla soup is labeled organic and gluten-free. It has just the perfect blend of spices that leaves a tingly dance on the tongue, and the softness of the shredded chicken is just right. If you've ever tried the Mexican dish pozole, the comfort and taste of this soup is similar to that. † Shrimp & Roasted Corn Chowder This take on the chowder is absolutely delightful. The blend of spices that were used will remind you more of a New England Clam Chowder than a regular corn chowder, while the shrimp and potatoes complete the New England style and taste. It's a delicious and healthy soup.  † Tomato Basil Soup Mixed with light cream, and slow-roasted tomatoes, Sup and J√ºs take on this classic is on the sweeter side of the spectrum, and manages to remind you of a comfy winter afternoon. Absolutely fantastic with their grilled cheese sandwich, which Hannigan was kind enough to let us try. Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Sandwiches Grilled Cheese Sandwich You would be surprised how hard it is for some places to make a proper grilled cheese. However, S√ºp and J√ºs does it just right. Not too bready, not too cheesy and not too buttery; the choice of cheddar and gruyere are perfect. The cheddar provides the sharpness, while the gruyere gives it a sweet and salty taste. It's amazing by itself or perfect with the tomato basil soup. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus Baked Goods Heath Bar Crunch Cookie  Hannigan said the heath bar crunch was the cafes second most popular cookie apart from the royale cookie which often gets sold out. It's a golden soft cookie topped with a crunchy toffee glaze and a buttery smell. The cookie was not crumbly or too thin or thick but better enjoyed if it was served warmed. The cookie is a medium sweet treat that can be carried out in a company with one of their Handlebar coffee options.  † Juices Tropical Coconut Vegan and gluten-free, this juice is made with organic coconut milk, strawberries and pineapple. The juice is rich in nutrients, and will leave you refreshed, perfect for the upcoming warmer months. † Overall, S√ºp and J√ºs is a convenient place to grab a nutritious meal for the day. The friendly staff and borrowed concepts makes you want to come back again. For deals happening during their grand opening, head to the S√ºp and J√ºs website.

Bringing with them a tradition of Italian cuisine, the couple established a legacy of freshly prepared and inexpensive food. Offering a wide assortment of Italian deli items and warm loaves of bread, Giuliano's in Gardena is the only location to feature multiple generations of descendants who have satisfied thousands of hungry customers for nearly 60 years. 
 Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Entering Giuliano's, you are presented with a large selection of fine deli meats and cheeses. From fresh cut roast beef to salamis and salads, Giuliano's offers a variety of deli items for customers to order at the counter. Customers can also purchase a variety of other ingredients to complement those prepared fresh î everything from olives and sauces to wines galore.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Alongside their deli, Giuliano's also has a fantastic bakery inside. Freshly baked and prepared daily, you can find classic favorites like their signature country French rolls and beer rye bread or sweet pastries like the custard-filled eclairs and strawberry shortcake.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Their shining glory in my opinion is their food, prepared using their in-house ingredients, which can be enjoyed for lunch in the Southern California sun outside or ordered out for catering. Their menu can be broken down into a few different sections: Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus While any one of their menu items is sure to be a favorite, we personally tried the Mediterranean Grilled Chicken sandwich and spaghetti marinara during our last visit. Both were packed with flavor and prepared upon order, helping to perfectly curb that afternoon hunger. The sandwich was well balanced, not at all dry and highlighted by the freshly baked bread. The pasta was similarly delicious, the sauce incorporating well and complemented by an extra touch of basil.  † Giuliano's is the perfect place to grab a few essentials or stop by for lunch with a loved one. With so much to offer, it can be difficult not to be overwhelmed by the smells that welcome you at the door alone. Be sure to set some time aside and stop by Giuliano's in Gardena to get a taste of generations' worth of Italian cuisine.

on-the-menu,I.V. Hangover/Drunchie Tier List,5-Apr-19,12:50 AM,['Leonard Paulasa'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-05/i-v-hangover-drunchie-tier-list/,"††† We're all aware of the reputation UCSB holds, and there will be days where we need to just let off some steam and partake in the countless festivities accessible by a simple walk down the streets of Isla Vista. Understandably, it becomes difficult to resist drinking with how easily accessible alcohol is (on top of the ingenious ways college students have made binge drinking fun). Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus So, in order to help my fellow Gaucho and Gauchettes overcome the inevitable hangover or drunchie they have or might experience î who are we kidding? †Deltopia's right around the corner î I've decided to try out various Isla Vista fast food locations in order to lessen the eventual struggle of picking where to go. Here are the results: The overall winner was decided based on all of the other four categories listed above. Domino's is the clear champion because they're somehow always a running a deal on their website, where you can buy a three-topping large pizza for carry-out for only $7.99. It's the perfectly greasy amount of food you'll crave as you reach the peak of your inebriation. It's also pretty damn good food to wake up to when hungover. Just pop your phone open, place a quick online order, build your pizza and head on over to Domino's. Since it's a large, you even have the option of sharing it with your friends î but let's be real, you know what you're capable of. Speaking of sharing with friends, nachos from Freebirds are the only acceptable runner-up in this category. The sheer quantity of nachos just oozing with cheese and whatever combination of toppings you decide î you know you'll pay extra for guac î is perfect to share with your friends as you all get lost in the sauce and every delicate bite of that soggy tortilla chip. For only $12.55 î but again, you'll probably pay extra for guac î you and your best buds will enjoy every bite and won't even remember who to Venmo. While we're on the topic of price, we already know that Domino's is the winner, but I'll be damned if Naan Stop's Chicken and Rice Bowl won't get a mention. This combination bowl is also a nice hangover cure that'll wake you up as soon as you get that kick from the spice, †coupled with the right amount of butter. Toss in some naan bread, and you won't even realize you paid less than $10 for two delicious meals. But what if you're really just hungover and desire that grease to offset the acidity and headache the plandle of Vitali you drank the night before left you with? Well, look no further, Rosarito has provided us with one of the most ingenious ways to feel so bad while feeling so good. Aside from your regular burrito contents, the Hangover Burrito has chicken tenders and tater tots in it. Yup, you read that right, chicken tenders and tater tots. As you're reading this, you might think that's gross and you wouldn't be the first to make that mistake. I thought the same thing, but the feeling I had when I ate this the day after a night of drinking was so unforgettable that I had to test it again and see where it stood as a drunchie. And you know what, it was still so good that I had to include it in the top three of drunchies. Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Now some key takeaways from this. Operating a phone can be difficult when you're drunk and we also don't know how long the Domino's deal will last, so maybe Domino's might not be the best overall for everyone. Same goes for Freebird's because the line can be a little agonizing when you're competing with a bunch of other drunk students struggling to decide what to put in their burritos and nachos. The Bagel Cafe is an underrated establishment, but unfortunately they're only open from 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. î †we all know we're not trying to leave our homes until at least 6 p.m. the day after drinking. On a more serious note, drinking is fun, but please remember to be responsible. It's definitely more fun if you're actually capable of remembering the memories you make when letting off some stress and hang out with friends. Additionally, being drunk is not an excuse to be rude to these establishments that are kind enough to handle us at some of our worst and most intolerable times so please be mindful and respectful. With that in mind, I hope you all have an amazing Deltopia.

on-the-menu,Koreatown's Best Corn Dogs,11-Apr-19,12:20 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/koreatowns-best-corn-dogs/,"If you've ever wanted to try Korea's most popular street food but don't have the funds to travel overseas, you've got to try Myungrang Hot Dogs in L.A.'s Koreatown. Unlike your typical American corn dog that's deep fried with a thick layer of cornmeal batter, Korean corn dogs are covered in panko and sugar, which makes them a lot crispier and sweeter than their American counterparts. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Myungrang Hot Dogs is a small grab-n-go spot located on the second floor of a cute, trendy plaza in the heart of Koreatown. After seeing countless mukbangs (audiovisual eating videos) of people eating these Korean corn dogs, I knew I had to try them for myself. I came around lunchtime on a Tuesday thinking that, despite the long lines I saw on Yelp, I didn't have to wait at all. The menu is pretty simple, offering corn dogs with a variety of fillings and toppings on the outside. The three that caught my eye were the mozzarella cheese, squid ink and potato corn dogs.  While I was waiting for my corn dogs, I noticed that Myungrang also offered an assortment of condiments to pair with the corn dogs. They have five different sauces including honey mustard, cheese mustard, ketchup, sweet chili and cheddar cheese, as well as three seasonings that include honey butter, cheese and parmesan cheese. I opted for a combination of mustard cheese sauce and honey butter seasoning on all of my corn dogs. Here's what I thought about the three corn dogs I tried: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus All Mozzarella Dog This is a must-try if you visit Myungrang! This corn dog is filled with mozzarella cheese that will give you that amazing long cheese pull that's perfect for the ògram. The crispy, sweet batter contrasts so well with the stringy, savory cheese that it'll leaving you wanting more. However, it can get a little heavy so I'd definitely share this one.  Squid-Ink Dog The batter for this corn dog is made with squid ink, and this corn dog is half sausage, half mozzarella cheese. The squid ink batter didn't taste like anything special and it was a little weird having the corn dog split like that. It would have been much better if the cheese was wrapped around the hot dog so that you could taste everything in one bite instead of eating the cheese first and then the hot dog. I wouldn't get this the next time I come, as it wasn't completely satisfying. Potato Dog This is the best corn dog here and another must-try! The potato dog is a Korean corn dog covered with small potato cubes that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It tastes like you're eating fries with a corn dog all in one bite. The other corn dogs I tried don't come anywhere close to the potato dog's unbelievable texture and flavor.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus After eating at Myungrang, I don't think I could ever go back to classic American corn dogs. The crispy panko and sugar really make these corn dogs unbelievably good, and on top of that, they're insanely cheap, priced from $3-4.50 per corn dog. It's perfect for sharing with friends, which is what I did, or you could definitely order a bunch and make your own mukbang!

It's a quesadilla,ù I said, enunciating every syllable. Kay-Suh-Dee-Yah: an easy starter dish, I thought, a comfortable segue into Mexican cuisine. I watched the pained look on my father's face as he struggled to swallow. My mother didn't even try. I DON'T LIKE IT,ù she said, pushing her portion away with defiance. Inwardly, I cringed. Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus Americans are picky eaters î or so seems to be the general consensus. Our bacon and egg breakfast, regarded as the emblem of Americanness, is high-fat, high-calorie and single-noted in flavor. Earlier this year, NPR writer Christine Ro reported that the American food aisle in foreign grocery stores, rather than being stocked with artisanal goods, is often filled with products like Pop-Tarts, Marshmallow Fluff and, of course, the notorious Twinkie. With characters like Ron Swanson, who boasts an ironclad policy of hard liquor and no rabbit food,ù even Americans concede that American cuisine is often nutritionally subpar, highly processed and limited in variety î so much so it's recognized as a comedic trope. The dry humor of Parks and Recreation,ù however, appears to be heavily outdated by most accounts. While the running joke of picky eating persists in sitcom television, studies show that millennials are actually among the most health-conscious individuals. According to a report from Pew Research, millennials are more health conscious than their parents were at [their] age,ù hence the popularity of recent trends like juicing, fasting and î the latest hit î goat yoga. The health and wellness industry, unsurprisingly, is currently valued at $7 trillion, and researchers are anticipating it to grow to roughly nine trillion by 2020. The stereotype of the bland, monopartite American diet also tends to be false: Millennials don't want the same sad burger that everyone else is eating,ù says Washington Post's Cara Rosenbloom. Never before has culinary creativity been so emphasized, with menu items like the much-acclaimed Mac òN' Cheese burger, or L.A.'s charcoal-activated ice cream. The newfound expansion and experimentation of food we see, according to Rosenbloom, is predominantly driven by [millennial tastes].ù Contrary to popular belief, the average 20-something is not only a health nut, but also a foodie. No longer is it enough for food to be quick and cheap; the age of the millennial is one with a particular palette and creativity standard î not like Ron Swanson's diet at all. We reside, instead, in an era during which the farm-to-table narrative is highly fetishized, and food is priced by virtue of being exoticù, one-of-a-kindù and artisanalù î the very qualities that young adults are passionate to consume. Christine Hoang, a fellow UCSB student, is such an example. A self-declared foodie, she runs a food Instagram, dedicating her page to photos of foods she's tried. I try so many different things,ù she tells me. Why not document it?ù I think the definition of being a foodie is being really passionate about food, trying new food, reviewing food,ù Hoang says. Are your friends foodies as well?ù I asked her. Hoang is perhaps among the more voracious of food lovers: None of my friends have food Instagrams, but they come along with me and they're just as willing as I am to try new food.ù Hoang's response nevertheless begs the question: If Americans are the notoriously picky eaters, why, then, are my friends the ones who crave variety in their diets, whereas my parents are the ones content with eating rice on the daily? Why are my friends the ones intent on eating their way around the world (i.e., the snack aisle at Trader Joe's) and my parents the ones resigned to one cuisine, forever, always? The pride that comes with being a foodie, so far as I can tell, appears to be a uniquely American invention. The U.S. has a recognizable food culture,ù says We're History's Christopher Gorham, who proposes that Americans have a distinctive fixation on food. While the idea of valuing creative or exotic foods is certainly present in other cultures, it hardly parallels the extent to which food has proliferated in American culture. Eve Turow, author of A Taste of Generation Yum: How the Millennial Generation's Love for Organic Fare, Celebrity Chefs, and Microbrews Will Make or Break the Future of Food, dedicates an entire chapter to this phenomenon in her book. Why is foodie culture exclusive to millennials, specifically American millennials? Mostly to show off,ù Turow retorts. We're using it as a signal of education, of knowledge, of income [¶] [They're] in essence, performing via food on social media.ù The desire to perform: Is there another value more integral to the American spirit? For the record, my parents ended up tossing the quesadilla and hitting up a different restaurant for dinner. Away we drove from the novelty of Latin America, turning instead to the safe, dependable flavor profile of Panda Express. My housemate, an international student, actually shares very similar dietary preferences to those of my parents. As much as she tries to familiarize herself with American food, Asian fusion is her go-to, leading to frequent and regimented stops at Hana Kitchen. Variety is her enemy. I just like it better,ù she told me. I've never tried much American food before,ù which is understandable. When she doesn't know all that much about it, how could she be expected to jump headfirst into American cuisine without missing the dishes she grew up with? How, furthermore, could she be expected to expand her palate to Italian food, Indian food, Tex-Mex and all the other obscure pockets of foodie culture? Do you ever try new types of food? Do you ever want to be adventurous?ù I asked her. Is she like me, who never orders the same thing twice as a point of pride?
My roommate was confused: People are proud of that?ù For the most part, she just wants her food to taste good. I admired how simple her answer was. In a culture that constantly strives to be out with the old, in with the new, I sometimes forget how uncomplicated food can be. The rigidity of my parents' palette is something with which I continually compromise, but I must admit: There's something charming (and strangely anxiety-relieving) about choosing to eat something not because it's exotic, one-of-a-kind or artisanal, but, as my roommate would say, just because it tastes good.

on-the-menu,It's Dumpling Time,21-Apr-19,12:15 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-21/dumpling-time/,"As an L.A. local, I have a hard time believing that any other food places compare to what I have in SoCal. After visiting the Bay and trying a bunch of restaurants, however, I realized that NorCal does have some really tasty food that is definitely comparable to the food we have in L.A. One restaurant that really impressed me was a restaurant called Dumpling Time. Located in San Francisco, Dumpling Time is a trendy Asian bistro that serves Chinese dim sum with a Californian twist. Since I don't go to the Bay a lot, I wanted to make the most of my experience here and ordered as much as I could. I really enjoyed all the dishes I tried, but you can take a look for yourself and decide whether or not you'd want to try it! Siu Mai I started off with the siu mai as an appetizer. Siu mai are open-faced dumplings and usually come in fours. It has a mixture of pork and shrimp wrapped in a piece of thin dumpling wrapping and topped with masago. The flavor and texture was good, but it wasn't anything super special. You could definitely find siu mai like this at another dim sum spot, so I would skip out on it if you already eat dim sum frequently. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Pork Gyoza Next, I tried the pork gyoza that had green onion, ginger and cilantro in the meat mixture. The gyozas dish came with five pieces and the skin was perfectly crispy while the meat inside was moist and flavorful. The taste and texture was spot on, so I'd definitely try this again. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Pork Xiao Long Bao and Tom Yum Goong Xiao Long Bao I wanted to try something unique to Dumpling Time, so I ordered the Tom Yum Xiao Long Bao, but I also had to go with the classic pork Xiao Long Bao. In the end, I just decided to order both, and definitely made the right decision. Each steamer came with six pieces and I really enjoyed the different flavors of them both. The pork xiao long baos came with pork belly meat inside with savory soup and shao-hsing wine. The hot, savory soup really hit the spot and the skin of the xiao long bao wasn't too thick, which is a sign of a good xiao long bao. The tom yum xiao long baos included a mixture of pork belly, shrimp and coconut milk and they were wrapped in a skin made with beets. Not only was the color absolutely beautiful, but the tom yum soup made the flavor really different from any other xiao long bao I've tried. I didn't really taste any beet flavor in the skin, but nonetheless, I was satisfied because the skin was also thin and smooth. All in all, I really appreciated the twist on traditional xiao long baos and I'd recommend this to anyone considering a visit to Dumpling Time! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus King Dum Xiao Long Bao I've seen variations of mega-sized xiao long baos all over social media, so I was extremely excited to try this out. This xiao long bao is probably equivalent to the size of five regular-sized xiao long baos and you even get a thick boba straw so you can drink the soup more easily. The King Dum Xiao Long Bao had a thicker skin, which was reasonable, because it had to hold together so much more meat and soup, but that took away from the ratio of dumpling skin to meat. It was a cool experience to stick the straw into the xiao long bao and drink the soup, but the bamboo steamer didn't have a bottom so the soup leaked out of the bottom. As for the meat mixture, it was just a little too much for me. All in all, it was a fun novelty experience, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Trio of Buns (Green Tea and Milk, Egg Yolk, Beets) I was already super full from all the dishes I had been trying, but what's a meal without dessert? Since I wanted to try as much as I could, I opted for the trio of buns, which all came with different fillings. The green tea and milk bun was my personal favorite, but all the buns had a nice, sweet custard filling. Normally, at traditional dim sum places, they just have the egg custard flavor buns, so Dumpling Time really impressed me with their variety of flavors and the vibrant color of the buns themselves. All in all, Dumpling Time is definitely worth the try! It's easier to go with a group of friends so you can try a lot of different things, but if you have a limited amount of time or limited stomach space, I would definitely try the Tom Yum Xiao Long Bao and Trio of Buns.

on-the-menu,Zucchini a la Checca,22-Apr-19,12:47 AM,['Paulina Leang'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-22/zucchini-a-la-checca/,"Forgot about those cherry tomatoes in the back of your fridge? And now, they're sort of shrivelled? Hold up!  According to the New York Times, 1.3 billion tons of food gets thrown away around the world per year. Imagine how many people would struggle a little bit less and how much cleaner the environment could be if we collectively decided to manage our food resources a little better.  Let's start with these tomatoes. Baby steps. Instead of tossing them into the garbage, let's toss them into a pan.  This recipe is for a vegan capellini alla checca with zoodles (zucchini noodles) instead of angel hair pasta. What's great about using smaller tomatoes instead of the traditional heirloom tomatoes is that 1) they inherently have more flavor and 2) they take up flavor faster, allowing you to skip the marinating time.  Before you start, you'll need a veggie spiralizer to make zoodles (this is one cost effective option). If you don't want to invest in one, that's perfectly okay; many grocers now sell spiralized vegetables for your convenience.  Paulina Leang / Daily Nexus Prep time: 15-20 minutes  † Makes 2-3 servings † Ingredients:  2 cups of spiralized zucchini/zoodles (two medium-sized zucchinis will yield about two cups) 1 cup of cherry or grape tomatoes, halved 1 sprig of fresh basil  3 tbsp garlic-infused olive oil 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar Vegan parmesan-style cheese alternative or nutritional yeast flakes Salt Pepper † Directions:  † Optional: † This recipe will last two days in the fridge. Maybe longer? Not sure as I've never made it that long without finishing the leftovers.  Buon appetito!

on-the-menu,Got Milk?: A Guide to Your Ever Growing Non-Dairy Options,25-Apr-19,12:08 AM,['Calista Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/got-milk-a-guide-to-your-ever-growing-non-dairy-milk-options/,"Nowadays, when you're walking around the supermarket, there seem to be more non-dairy milk choices than ever. New research from Mintel says that non-dairy milk sales have grown an impressive 61% since 2012. With many reasons to choose non-dairy milk, this increase in sales makes sense. Some people are lactose intolerant and unable to drink dairy milk. Other people are vegan and do not consume animal products. Some people choose non-dairy milk to improve their health. Others choose to drink less cow milk to reduce their negative impact on the environment, as dairy cows produce a significant amount of methane and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Some people simply think drinking milk from other animals is unnatural. † Regardless of your reason for choosing non-dairy milk on your next grocery run, from the popular almond milk to the lesser known hemp milk, deciding which non-dairy milk is right for you can be overwhelming. As more and more people choose non-dairy milk over cow's milk, the number of available options seems to grow. Here is your guide to six different types of non-dairy milk as you make the choice to consume less dairy. Courtesy of pixabay.com Soy milk: Most comparable to cow's milk, soy milk is rich and creamy with 100 calories and seven grams of protein per eight ounce serving. Also, it is one of the few plant-based sources of high-quality completeù protein. Soy milk provides the body with all the essential amino acids it must obtain from your diet. Made from grinding dry soybeans with water, the taste is distinctive with a slight soybean taste and is often described as nutty or sweet. Although soy is one of the more controversial foods î it contains large amounts of isoflavones which can affect estrogen receptors in the body and the function of hormones î there is no conclusive evidence on moderate soy consumption causing harm to the average adult.  † Almond milk: Thinner in texture than 2% cow's milk, almond milk is one of the lowest calorie non-dairy milks. With approximately 40 calories per eight ounce serving, it is not a significant source of protein or fiber. This non-dairy choice is a natural source of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that combats inflammation and stress in the body while also protecting against heart disease and cancer. A popular non-dairy choice, almond milk has a slightly sweet and nutty taste.  † Coconut milk: Made from water and the white meat of brown coconuts, coconut milk is known for its rich and creamy texture, as well as a sweet, coconut taste. Per eight ounce serving, it contains approximately 45 calories. Overall, coconut milk has the lowest protein and carbohydrate content out of all the non-dairy milk options. However, moderate coconut milk consumption can help heart health by raising the good cholesterol levels in the body.  Courtesy of maxpixel.net Flax milk: Made from cold-pressed flaxseed oil mixed with water, flax milk is the most comparable non-dairy milk to cow milk in terms of taste. Texture-wise, flax milk is most similar to skim milk †or 1% milk and is thin and smooth. Depending on the brand, the calories in an eight ounce serving can range from 25-60. Flax milk does not contain protein or fiber, but it is high in omega-3 fatty acids and contains 30% of the recommended dietary allowance of calcium.  † Oat milk: A favorite in Europe, oat milk has a mildly sweet flavor and creamy texture. Made from pre-soaked oat groats (hulled whole grains) oat milk is most comparable to low-fat or fat free milk and contains approximately 130 calories per eight ounce serving. It is high in fat and carbohydrates with around 25 grams of each. Oat milk is high in total fiber and beta-glucan, which can help lower cholesterol levels. Like the popular soy and almond milks, oat milk is becoming more prevalent in coffee shops as an option for non-dairy milk. † Hemp milk: Made from the seeds of the hemp plant, hemp milk (Cannabis Sativa) comes from the same plant species used to make the drug cannabis, commonly known as marijuana. Although it is sweet and nutty, hemp milk has a more acquired taste with its †thin and watery texture. In an eight ounce serving, it contains approximately 60 calories, five grams of fat and two grams of protein. Disclaimer: Consuming this non-dairy milk will not result in mind-altering effects, as hemp seeds only contain trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol.

on-the-menu,What Type of Non-Dairy Milk Are You?,25-Apr-19,12:13 AM,['Calista Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/what-type-of-non-dairy-milk-are-you/,"Drinking milk straight from the cow is so early 2000s. It's 2019, and nearly everyone and their mother is drinking some form of non-dairy cow milk alternative, whether this is in the form of a soy latte or almond milk with your cereal in the morning. Not only can non-dairy milk be just as tasty as cow milk, but it's also healthier for you, better for the cows and better for our environment! As the old adage goes, you are what you eat î in this case drink î so read on to find out what type of non-dairy milk you are. Courtesy of commons.wikimedia.org Soy milk: You're a feminist who participated in UCSB's first annual Women's Empowerment Conference. You had not one, but two picket signs at this year's Women's March. While you're definitely wokeù on today's social justice issues, you're also a proud sorority girl in line at Starbucks because who doesn't love a venti skinny iced vanilla latte with light ice, sub non-fat milk with soy milk? These lattes give you an extra pep in your step as you continue to fight the patriarchy.  † Almond milk: You've got the whole boy/girl-next-door charm going on, and you're just the kind of person everyone wants to bring home to meet the parents. Well-known by your peers and well-rounded in academics, athletics and extracurriculars, you've perfected the act of juggling all of your responsibilities with your busy social life. In your free time, you enjoy cooking meals for the homeless, knitting blankets for the elderly and tutoring underprivileged children in S.T.E.M. † Coconut milk: Just like many people don't realize the coconut is, botanically speaking, a fibrous one-seeded drupe and can be classified as a fruit, a nut and a seed, many people don't realize that there's more to you than what meets the eye. You have a lot to offer this world and would appreciate it if people stopped making assumptions about you. You're fun! You like to crack jokes! You like to travel to exotic places! If more people took the time to know you, they would know this too.  † Flax milk: You take health and fitness to the next level. Fast food? Never heard of her. Days off? The grind never stops. You work out five to seven days a week, and your meals mainly consist of sauteed vegetables dressed in olive oil and grilled chicken. Meal prepping is your religion, and you go to bed every Sunday with a refrigerator full of Tupperware for all your meals throughout the week. Through your dedication to your health, you've managed to reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes by 93.62%. However, you do like to let loose every once in a while, and your go-to drinks on the weekend are White Claws and Boochcraft. † Oat milk: You're a very reliable person with a comforting presence. Your hobbies include baking, crafting and home improvement. You went abroad and have never felt more at home than in Europe where you were immediately surrounded by your other like-minded oat milks. Upon returning to America, you can't help but feel like something is missing. Still, as much as you loved the adventure of being abroad, you're content to spend time with your friends and family. † Hemp milk: 4/20 is your favorite holiday, but why limit yourself to just one day? For you, every day is 4/20. You just bought a new bong to add to your collection and are an expert at rolling the perfect joint. You have a very laid back and carefree personality and a life goes onù mentality. As your idol Bob Marley once said, Don't worry, be happy,ù and you take his advice to heart. You probably own weed leaf socks. † Cashew milk: You and your fellow hazelnut and macadamia nut milks honestly feel a bit underappreciated. Why does almond milk get all the attention? You're all practically related anyway. What gives?

on-the-menu,TASA's 14th Annual Night Market,2-May-19,12:23 AM,['Michelle Wan'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/tasas-14th-annual-night-market/,"On Friday night, April 26, Storke Plaza was crawling with UCSB students looking to spend their night hanging with friends at the Taiwanese American Student Association's (TASA) 14th Annual Night Market. This event allowed students to experience Taiwan's most exciting tourist point: its popular night markets.  Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus With the help from the Korean American Student Association (KASA), Japanese Language Cafe (JLC), Alpha Phi Omega (AŒ¶Œ©) and several other student organizations, the market-goers were able to taste the flavors of different Asian cultures all in one place.  Unlike other Taiwanese night market imitations in Los Angeles, Orange County and other locations, admission to walk amongst the market was free. However, tickets for the food were sold for $1 each.  To beat the long line for tickets at the event, TASA began to sell tickets at the Arbor two weeks beforehand. Pre-sale tickets were offered at $10 for 12 or $20 for 24 along with two free custom-made stickers. Clearly, this deal attracted the eyes of many students, and, according to one of the staff members of TASA, they were able to sell about 2,000 tickets within those two weeks. The student organizations were able to provide a variety of dishes for the market-goers, such as minced pork rice from TASA, kimchi fried rice from the Alpha Tau Pledge Class\ and grilled pork skewers from the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA). Along with these savory foods, students were also able to enjoy several desserts, such as egg waffle from Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA) and halo halo from ŒëŒ¶Œ© and wash them down with a cup of black milk tea, green milk tea or winter melon tea, courtesy of TASA.  Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus All of the items served were less than $10, with the most expensive dish being served at $7 per two pieces of rice cakes and sausages from KASA. While people milled around and ate, they were entertained by performances by SS805, Black Reign and Chokis.  I started the night out with a generous portion of minced pork rice, and I paid an extra dollar for an egg. The dish had an authentic taste and seemed to have potential to become something more. The minced pork toppingù was a bit too salty, but it's common for this dish to be on the saltier side, so I would give this dish an 8/10.  For dessert, I decided to go for the egg waffle from HKSA. For $2 extra, I had fresh fruits added on top of a peanut butter covered waffle with whipped cream on top and a drizzle of condensed milk. I appreciated their quick service after having to wait quite a while in the halo-halo line.  Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus Leaving the halo-halo line was a good idea because the egg waffle tasted delicious; the fruit on top added a fresh taste, which was very satisfying. Although, it was a bit hard to eat because I was only given a fork, so I ate the toppings first and then the waffle. In the end, I was content with this dessert, and I would give it a 9/10.  Finally, I washed my meal down with a cup of black milk tea with boba for just $4. Even though I am grateful that they provided milk tea at this event, it was not as satisfying as purchasing a $5 cup at Mojo. The boba was stuck together due to the way they stored them for the event, which made it hard to ration the boba and milk tea intake. What's more is that the milk tea was warm since it was prepared hot and ice was added when served. Despite all this, the milk tea was not too sweet and did not taste bad; I would give it a 5/10. From the outside, the event looked like a regular night market with people waiting in endless lines and pushing through the crowd in hopes of keeping up with their friends. But soon enough, disaster struck.  As usual, TASA's popcorn chicken was a crowd favorite, and people were lining up to score a plate of this night market classic.  Unfortunately, the fryer decided to stop working, forcing the staff members to hand-fry the chicken with pots and pans. This delay caused the line for the popcorn chicken to be extremely long and slow. Additionally, some of the chicken was not properly fried, and a staff member received complaints about uncooked chicken.  Although a great event, it was rather disorganized. Due to the limited space and many people, it was difficult to navigate through the crowds and even harder to figure out which tables were selling what food. Additionally, the long lines made it hard to distinguish where they started and which booth was at the end. Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus Several pieces of advice for people looking to attend next year: Despite all of its setbacks, this night market was a great way for UCSB students to destress during midterm season and experience a night of culture and fun.
Print Interestingly enough to halo halo was a fan favorite by many since most of the organizations didn't even have their food prepared u tile much later in the night Halo-halo was bomb affff wdym i love me some halo-halo all day errryday that line for halo-halo was so long, but well worth the wait I hope they sell halo-halo every year at TASA night market

on-the-menu,Santa Barbara Fair & Expo Carnival Celebrates 30th Year,2-May-19,12:40 AM,['Marilu Bedolla'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/the-santa-barbara-county-fair-celebrates-128-years/,"Santa Barbara took a bite of carnival foods this past weekend at a dinosaur-themed fair and exhibit. On Saturday night, the funnel cake station had the biggest line out of all the food vendors, demonstrating which fair food was most popular among the crowd. But funnel cakes were not the only treats available î some people opted for the classic hot dog while others tried the trendy foods and desserts. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus This is a guide to the 2019 fair food menu that is worth checking out. The categories judged were based off of price, presentation and overall flavor. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus 5. Chicken Teriyaki Not in for a sweet treat? Try the chicken teriyaki served on a bamboo skewer. The meat is tender, juicy and packed with a sweet and tangy sauce that drips off your mouth with every bite. What is nice is that the meat strips off easily and the chunks of meat are large. While the chicken teriyaki was smoked and seasoned to perfection, at $15 for two skewers, you are better off getting a bang for your buck somewhere else. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus 4. Deep-Fried Oreos Do you want a fluffy sweet treat? The deep-fried Oreo can satisfy that need. The outside of the fried dough is lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar, providing a subtle sweetness when you first bite into the treat. As you further bite into the center, you are met with a warm, melted Oreo cookie that gushes with white creme, completing the missing sweet element the treat needs. Served to order and ready in less than three minutes, deep-fried Oreos are a quick fix to a person's sweet tooth. Priced at $5, this treat is for one serving î perfect if you are looking for a personalized snack. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus 3. Chili Cheese Fries Fairs are known for their heavy comfort food, and this fair was no exception. The loaded chili cheese fries take the third spot for worthy fair food, not because of their presentation but because they are filling and topped off with the right amount of sauces. The soft fries could have been sold on their own with a layer of the creamy cheddar sauce, since the sauce was melted enough to smoother all over the fries and did not stiffen as time went on. The chili had bits of ground beef that floated among the sauce, but was not flavorful enough to make an impact on the dish. The fries cost $12.75, the amount you would expect for large-portioned food at the fair. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus 2. Hawaiian Honey Cones Not in the mood for a warm treat and looking for a frozen treat? The Hawaiian Honey Cones are just right for you. The J-shaped ice cream cone tastes like honey and is thick in density, allowing it to hold ice cream. The cone is filled with a rich vanilla Hokkaido ice cream, a Japanese-inspired flavor, which makes it taste fresh and not artificial or watery. The treat wins points for being trendy and tasting like honey, living up to its name. It goes for $7 a cone and is worth every penny because the cone concept is unique and the ice cream leaves you wanting more, but you can only get this treat at the Hawaiian Honey Cones stands. Marilu Bedolla / Daily Nexus 1. Bacon-Wrapped Hot Dog The bacon-wrapped hot dog took the number one spot because it looks appetizing and is packed with a variety of ingredients and flavors. This was a jumbo hot dog grilled in thin pieces of bacon wrapped all around. Apart from chicken, mayo and mustard, people had the option to add grilled onions and bell peppers for free. The onions were soft and crisp from their caramelization while the green bell peppers were also soft but remained crunchy. The grilled onions and green bell peppers complemented the savory hot dog, as the sweetness of the onions and juiciness of the bell peppers provided a punch of flavors and textures. While the dog was $11, it was worth the price because the service was fast and the hot dog was not plain or small. A local college resident says the prices charged at the fair are high, but they still enjoyed the experience of getting on rides and trying several fair foods. What I did enjoy was the deep-fried Oreos; they were fantastic,ù Niko Estrada, environmental studies major at UC Santa Barbara, said. I don't go in with the expectation of eating healthy foods ¶ you go to indulge.ù Groups of people came out to enjoy the 30th annual Santa Barbara Fair and Expo, which ran from Wednesday of last week until this past Sunday. There were as many food vendors for people try as there were ride options for people to experience.

on-the-menu,Taco Tuesdays at Downtown's El Paseo Mexican Restaurant,2-May-19,12:49 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/taco-tuesdays-at-downtowns-el-paseo-mexican-restaurant/,"We all need an escape from midterm season, and what better way to take a break than by grabbing a delicious meal with your friends or classmates? El Paseo Mexican Restaurant in downtown Santa Barbara has been serving the community with its authentic Mexican cuisine since 1922. It's a hidden gem all the way back in a plaza that embodies a Spanish village. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The restaurant is built like a historic adobe complex and is decorated with some greenery and beautiful string lights that illuminate your dining experience, making it the perfect place to relax and ease up as you try to ignore all your exams and papers that are piling up. One thing unique to El Paseo is their all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday. Every Tuesday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., diners can indulge in a taco bar buffet for only $9. The restaurant can accommodate small groups for a more intimate dining experience, but it is also large enough to seat bigger groups if you're celebrating a special occasion. The waiters serve you warm tortilla chips with salsa as soon as you're seated, but don't snack on those for too long because the real star of the show is the taco bar. Customers have the option of hard shell tacos and two varieties of soft tortillas: corn or flour. Although I usually prefer corn tortillas for my tacos, the flour tortillas at El Paseo are to die for. They are thin enough so they don't overpower the tacos with a bready flavor, but they're also thick enough to hold everything together. El Paseo serves chicken, pork and beef paired with all the taco toppings you usually eat like tomatoes, onions, cilantro and sour cream. Since it's a buffet, you can feel free to pile up as many ingredients as you want in your tacos and really take advantage of the all-you-can-eat aspect of this meal. Personally, I put a lot on my tacos and can only eat two or three each time I visit. El Paseo also has a regular dinner menu for the rest of the week and Happy Hour Mondays-Fridays from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. when all house margaritas and appetizers are half off. This is definitely one of the best deals in town, and it doesn't get too crowded, so be sure to visit the next time you take a trip downtown.

on-the-menu,Catch of the Day: Dinner Date at The Lobster,3-May-19,12:00 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/catch-of-the-day-dinner-date-at-the-lobster/,"Santa Barbara is arguably home to some of the best seafood, but that didn't stop me from traveling down the coast to Santa Monica to get a taste of the food it has to offer. For mine and my boyfriend's anniversary, we made a dinner reservation at The Lobster, a fine dining seafood establishment right off the beautiful Santa Monica pier and Pacific Ocean.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Our reservation was at 6 p.m., and I'm glad we made a reservation because when we got there, almost all the tables were full and even the bar area was bustling with people. As the hostess led us to our table, the first thing I noticed was the incredible view. The restaurant had a huge window that overlooked the pier and beach which made it feel like you were dining right outside, but without any of the wind. Even though it was a bit gloomy that day, the view still added a very nice element to our dining experience. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I got the shellfish and black chitarra pasta while my boyfriend opted for the butter poached American lobster. The housemade pasta came with clams, mussels, wild Mexican shrimp, dungeness crab, calamari, tomatoes, basil and chili flakes. The pasta itself was very subtle in flavor, which was good because it made the seafood the real star of the dish. All the shellfish was extremely fresh and flavorful, making this a really solid entree. It was enough to fill me up, but not so much that I was too full for a nice walk on the pier afterwards. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The lobster was plated on top of lobster mashed potatoes with swiss chard and beech mushrooms and surrounded by a decadent lobster americaine sauce. The Lobster is definitely not stingy with their portions, as we were served a decent-sized lobster tail and claw. The lobster meat was perfectly buttered and tasted amazing, especially with the sauce. The mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious, as they were creamy and flavorful, and the mushrooms and chard provided perfect bursts of additional flavor tucked under the lobster meat.  † All in all, The Lobster gave me and boyfriend the perfect dining experience for our anniversary. Although it's a bit pricey for college students, the amazing food, beautiful view and exceptional service made our experience worth every penny. I'd love to come back and try their other menu items î especially for happy hour.

I usually purchase and cook with the same ingredients, but this time I wanted to try something new. I purchased a pound of their beef sirloin tips and some broccoli for a simple, savory dinner for my roommate and I to cook together. Here's how I prepared and cooked my steak dinner. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: 1 lb sirloin tips 3/4 cups of broccoli flowers 4 tablespoons canola oil 4 cloves garlic, finely minced 1/4 teaspoon 21 Seasoning Salute 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper 1 cup white rice (You can get this from the A.S. Food Bank!) Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I really liked this recipe because it cost less than $15 for the two of us, and we even had some leftovers that we saved for lunch the next day. The sirloin steak tips weren't as juicy as more expensive steak would be, but they were worth it for the price and made us very full.  Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,East Meets the Pacific Northwest: An Asian Palate Invasion in Portland,9-May-19,12:41 AM,['Paulina Leang'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/east-meets-the-pacific-northwest-an-asian-palate-invasion-in-portland/,"Anytime I find myself in a vibrant city with a population in excess of half a million or with a significant population of Asians and Asian Americans, my intuition is that the food must be î has to be î good, especially the Asian food. Growing up in San Luis Obispo County and now living in Santa Barbara, there is usually a lot left to be desired after sad attempts to satisfy Asian food cravings by means of local purveyors (the only exception being sushi). Needless to say, I always have a hunger and a void I am so ready to fill with the tastiest of Pan-Asian flavors. On a recent trip to Portland, I was able to indulge myself î albeit briefly î with Din Tai Fung, Afuri: Ramen and Izakaya and Luc Lac Vietnamese Kitchen. Paulina Leang / Daily Nexus DIN TAI FUNG A Taiwanese outfit gone global, known for its xiaolongbao. Its Hong Kong location was the first restaurant in Taiwan to receive a Michelin star. The Portland location is located in Washington Square, a mall in the city's outskirts. Suburban setting aside, the food was impeccably delicious as always. Consistency and precision are likely what make Din Tai Fung a favorite for many dumpling lovers worldwide. I opted for the shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup and the cucumber salad, which was the perfect amount of food and comfort for a party of one on a cold and rainy Pacific Northwest day. Knowing what to expect and then having your expectations met is always comforting. Paulina Leang / Daily Nexus AFURI: Ramen + Izakaya A Japanese import, renowned for its ramen. It specifically chose Portland because the water quality was ideal to create excellent broth by its standards. Every ramen aficionado knows that the flavor of broth is crucial for a well-executed noodle soup dish. I ordered the Asari Shoyu Ramen, complete with clams, chashu pork, leek, scallions and a truffle jam in a hot bath of clam and chicken broth. When it arrived in front of me, the steam escaping the surface of the broth tantalized my taste buds. I ate every last bit of that ramen and licked every last drop of the soup. It was that good. Paulina Leang / Daily Nexus LUC LAC Vietnamese Kitchen A Vietnamese-American joint, known for its late-night hours. You can order food up until closing time at 4 a.m. The restaurant was named for the traditional Vietnamese and Cambodian beef dish that both travelers and locals love alike. Sounds super appealing, right? Unfortunately, Luc Lac seemed lacking to me. I ordered a bowl of pho and the shrimp and pork spring rolls. Just as broth makes or breaks a bowl of ramen, it does the same for pho. Although pho broth usually goes down well with a tinge of sweetness, Luc Lac's broth was a tad bit too sweet for my taste. The pork in the spring rolls was on the dry side. I sat at the bar, where the bartender effectively ignored me for almost my entire time there. Toward the end, he asked me, How was everything?ù to which I replied, It was okay.ù He didn't have a response for me. Staying at a hotel two blocks down, I had walked past this restaurant many times to see a line out the door with people patiently waiting to get in. I was disappointed, to say the least. But there is something about late-night food that can always be appreciated. Paulina Leang / Daily Nexus Portland is a city with many offerings, and this was just a small sliver of my experiences. Although time and finances limited all that I could explore, I was glad to be able to experience at least a few arguably delicious establishments. Next time you're in Portland, consider giving these restaurants a try.

on-the-menu,Eco-Friendly Changes at Local Coffee Spots,11-May-19,12:06 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-11/eco-friendly-changes-at-local-coffee-spots/,"Earth Day has come and gone this year, but the environmental mindfulness this day promotes should remain. It can sometimes be easy to assume the acts we do won't make a huge difference to our planet. However, making small changes to our everyday behavior î such as coffee drinking, for instance î is what can save our environment in the long run. One of the most recent issues that has sparked discussion in environmental topics today is the harmful impact of plastic straw use by restaurants and coffee shops. Not only do plastic straws have fatal effects on marine life, but they're too small to be recycled, making them pile up as waste. Luckily, many local coffee shops have taken the initiative and changed their habits by eliminating the use of plastic straws. In order to continue this year promoting more conscious consumption habits, I have provided you all the information you will need to navigate the most environmentally-friendly coffee spots on and off campus.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Starbucks at the UCen: I was very happy to find out that the UCen Starbucks has switched from plastic to compostable straws for their customers. I still have yet to see one of their new strawless lids for iced drinks, but this effort shows that they are being more conscious about their environmental footprint. Be warned though, not every Starbucks location in the area has taken up this practice. Both the location in IV, as well as the one in the Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta, have yet to make the shift to compostable straws. Hopefully this change will soon carry over to every nearby location. † The Store at Buchanan coffee stand: This convenient on-campus coffee cart which works to serve those very necessary caffeine pick-me-ups between classes has also taken an eco-friendly initiative by replacing their plastic straws with compostable ones. If you're ever in need of a cheap, quick coffee without the guilt of wasting plastic, stop by this spot on campus! † The Arbor: Once again, YAY for student convenience and compostable straws!  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Caj√©: Everyone's favorite coffee shop and study spot in I.V. has also made many environmentally-friendly changes in their work practices. When people sit either inside or out on the Caj√© patio while drinking their coffee, the workers always provide drinks in either a washable ceramic or glass cup with no straw to individuals. This is not only a better alternative to plastic or paper cups, but it also gives Caj√© the welcoming atmosphere we all know and love. If you do need to order an iced coffee to go, they also provide paper straws! † The French Press: If you ever are in the mood to venture outside of campus or I.V. for your coffee fix, The French Press in Goleta or downtown is one of my favorite spots to study. Like Caj√© î †if you choose to drink inside (which I highly recommend) î †the workers will bring you a washable cup without a straw. The French Press has also switched to compostable straws to maintain their eco-friendly theme.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus While many local favorites are beginning to adopt new methods with less environmental consequences, there are still some coffee shops that have not. If you ever find yourself at a coffee shop or restaurant that only offers plastic straws, there are still some things you can do to help the environment. One way is by simply ordering a hot drink rather than an iced one. I can almost guarantee that no coffee shop will offer you a straw with a warm drink, and it may pair well with the overcast weather we have been having in Santa Barbara. Another step many people are beginning to take is purchasing their own reusable metal straws. More and more people are switching over to this option in order to ensure they are never stuck in a situation where they have to use plastic. The final alternative I have to offer is to go to a more sit-down, casual coffee spot like Caj√©, The French Press or Handlebar where they won't give you a straw unless you ask for one. These little measures can really make a difference in the long run.  † The Santa Barbara and Goleta community is definitely making strides in the right direction with the amount of environmentally-friendly changes being made in their coffee shops. The harm of plastic straws to both our planet and wildlife should not be ignored, and it is our job to acknowledge this by making these small everyday changes to our lives.

on-the-menu,Cozy Local Coffee Shops to Cram In,16-May-19,12:22 AM,['Rinah Anatalio'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/cozy-local-coffee-shops-to-cram-in/,"Since midterm season never ends in the quarter system, continually going to the same study spot each week can get boring. Luckily, Santa Barbara and Goleta are home to various aesthetic coffee shops to study in. All of these places offer WiFi and have an assortment of small snacks to enjoy while grinding through a paper or study guide.  Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Old Town Coffee Old Town Coffee is located in Old Town Goleta, right on Hollister Avenue. This spot is perfect for studying because it is moderately quiet and has multiple outlets available to charge your devices. Their coffee is great, and they offer vegan and dairy-free milk substitutions. Many of their snacks come from other local businesses in the Santa Barbara area, such as empanadas from Buena Onda and sweet pastries from D'Angelo's. Furthermore, their space is nicely decorated with a rustic vibe. Even if you don't find yourself studying at Old Town, they have a beautiful outside space with games like cornhole and ping-pong. Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Hook and Press Donuts Hook and Press is a relatively new spot located on State Street. They offer beautiful gourmet donuts that are freshly made each morning. Hook and Press sells the most aesthetic donuts in Santa Barbara. If you love posting your food on your Instagram story, then this place is for you! Their donut flavors can vary depending on the season and holidays. Although this is a donut shop, they also serve coffee from Dune Coffee Roaster's and an assortment of juices from Juice Ranch. Hook and Press offers free WiFi for their customers as well. This shop shares a space with other food vendors, which can make the space a bit louder than most other study spaces but is nevertheless a great spot to study. Their social media is constantly updated with flavor announcements and deals, so keep an eye out for that! Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Breakfast Culture Club Breakfast Culture Club is a trendy coffee shop located in downtown Santa Barbara. They offer Handlebar Coffee Roasters' coffee along with teas and kombucha on tap. They also have an assortment of delicious gourmet toasts and pastries. Breakfast Culture Club has free WiFi as well as many tables and outlets for studying. Although they play music, it is calming and the noise level is still moderate. They offer vegan and dairy-free milk substitutions in addition to gluten-free bread. I highly recommend the Cinnamon Sugar Toast because it tastes like a giant piece of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. This place is often filled with students, so it is best to go early in the morning in order to get a good spot! Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Handlebar Coffee Roasters Handlebar Coffee Roasters is a local coffee shop with two locations in Santa Barbara and a very hipster atmosphere. They source their coffee beans from Central and South America as well as Africa and roast them in house, which makes their coffee unique. Handlebar offers a variety of pastries from other local businesses in Santa Barbara. There is free WiFi and plenty of tables at both locations, but both lack a sufficient number of power outlets, so it's best to have your devices charged beforehand. The noise level in Handlebar is moderate, but it is often very busy. The workers at Handlebar are all very sweet, and I personally think they make the best latte art!

on-the-menu,Feast of the Seven Kingdoms,16-May-19,12:30 AM,"['Winnie Lam', 'Tiffany Velazquez']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/feast-of-the-seven-kingdoms/,"After waiting years for winter to come, it's sad to see the Game of Thronesù series finally drawing †to an end. In order to cope with the fact that we're going to be seeing the last episode this Sunday, we've curated a list of Game of Thronesù themed food that tastes so good it'll keep your mind off the fact that we won't be seeing our favorite characters ever again. These foods are easy to make and they're perfect for a Game of Thronesù viewing party where we can cry and laugh with the Starks, Targaryens and Lannisters one last time. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Deviled Dragon Eggs It's amazing how much Daenerys and her dragons have been through since they first hatched at the end of Season 1. It was heartbreaking to watch Viserion fight for the Night King and Rhaegal fall into the ocean at the hands of Euron Greyjoy, so it's easier to think back to the simpler times when they were just beautiful dragon eggs. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus In order to make these dragon deviled eggs, you'll need four eggs, blue food coloring, º cup of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of mustard, 2 strips of bacon and paprika. Boil the eggs for 9 minutes and put them in an ice bath to cool down. Then, gently crack the egg shells but don't peel them. Place each egg in a Ziploc bag and put 2 drops of food coloring on the egg before gently rolling it around in the bag until the entire shell is covered with the food coloring. Set the eggs aside for 30 minutes. While you're waiting, cook your bacon and cut them into small pieces in a separate bowl.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Rinse off your eggs, peel them and cut them in half vertically. Scoop out the egg yolks and add them into the bowl with the bacon and then add the mayonnaise and mustard.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Mix all the ingredients together for the deviled eggs filling. Put a generous amount of filling into each egg and top with paprika. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Brienne of Tarts As one of the strongest yet underrated fighters in Westeros, Brienne of Tarth definitely deserved a dessert dedicated to her.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus To make these fruit tarts, you'll need 6 premade mini graham cracker crusts, 2 vanilla Jello-O pudding snack cups, 1ÅÑ2 cup of whipped topping and any fruits of your choice. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus This dessert is extremely simple as all you need to do is empty 2 pudding cups into a large bowl and gently fold in the whipped topping. Then, fill each crust with the filling and top with your favorite fruits.This is sure to be a crowd-pleaser since the tartness of the fruit goes well with the sweet flavor of the filling! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Sansa's Lemon Cakes Sansa Stark's journey throughout the series is probably one of my favorite instances of character development. She's one of the strongest female figures in the show, and who can forget her favorite dessert, lemon cakes?  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus It's too time consuming to recreate the lemon cakes with eight seasons' worth of plot on your mind, so I just followed a box recipe for a lemon pound cake and paired it with some strawberries. The cake's citrus aroma and sweet taste was delightful. It's a shame that Sansa couldn't have these all the time, as I can't imagine how the Starks could grow lemons in Winterfell. Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Theon's Pigs in a Blanket  It wouldn't be a proper viewing party without a nod to Theon, who died as both a Greyjoy and a Stark after a brutally dark journey. While he did make up for his past mistakes by helping Sansa to flee from Ramsay and dying at the hands of the Night King to defend Bran, I had to have at least a little fun with this one by giving a nod to the series' most sadistic villain. Fans will not soon forget Ramsay Bolton's murderous ways or his physical and psychological torture of Theon. Even so, you can't make it through eight seasons of Game of Thronesù without attempting to make light of the constant violence and bloodshed. In order to make this homage to Ramsay's castration and later mocking of Theon î who can forget how this bastard made him think the sausage he was eating was a more familiar body part? î you'll need sausage links, crescent rolls and cheddar cheese. Cook the sausage links on medium-high heat according to the instructions on the package, making sure to turn often. Once cooled, separate the crescent dough into triangles and wrap it around the sausage link with a bit of cheddar cheese added in. Bake for 12-15 minutes in a 375∞ oven or until golden brown. Let cool before enjoying, and make eye contact with your guests while eating if you really want to mess with them.  Tiffany Velazquez / Daily Nexus Wildfire Jell-O Shots Wildfire has played an important role since before the events of the series unfolded. Though intending †to destroy the entirety of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion, the Mad King's plot was stopped before it was carried out and resulted in the events that named Jaime the Kingslayer. With the series ending and everything going up in literal flames during last week's episode, we recreated this flammable liquid with another equally dangerous one î vodka!  Follow the directions on the Jell-O box, boiling one cup of water and adding it to a large mixing bowl with the Jell-O powder. Stir the mixture together until the Jell-O has completely dissolved before adding Ω cup of cold water and Ω cup of vodka to the bowl. Stir everything until fully mixed and pour into plastic shot glasses, filling the cups about three- fourths of the way. Chill the Jell-O shots for about 3 hours or until set. If you really want to be destructive, make a drinking game out of the final episode and down a shot every time the writers destroy another character's series-long arc.

on-the-menu,Trader Joe's Pollo Asado Tacos Recipe,16-May-19,12:26 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/trader-joes-pollo-asado-tacos-recipe/,"This week at Trader Joe's I decided to try the marinated Pollo Asado, which translates to flame-roasted chicken.ù In the package, you get several pieces of thinly sliced chicken breast with an authentic Mexican blend of seasoning. The meat is meant for easy grilling, so I decided to make street tacos with it. I also bought some corn tortillas, a red onion, cilantro, mini avocados, a lemon and a Mexican blend of shredded cheese. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The tacos were super easy to make, as all you have to do is cook each piece of chicken on medium high heat for 4-5 minutes on each side and your entire kitchen will be filled with the savory aroma of chicken tacos. I had about four slices of chicken in my package, so I decided to save two pieces for the next day. I let the rest of my slices of cooked chicken cool down on a cutting board and then cut them into small, bite-sized pieces.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Then I minced half of the red onion and cilantro to pair with the chicken meat. I sliced the lemon for fresh lemon juice to squeeze on the top of the tacos and I thinly sliced the avocado as well to add some more texture to the tacos. I warmed up the corn tortillas on low heat and assembled my tacos with the meat, vegetables and avocado before topping it off with some cheese. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus This dinner was delicious, and it was plentiful enough to satisfy myself and two of my housemates, not to mention I only used half of the meat in the package. The meat was well-seasoned and flavorful, but since I cooked the meat on a pan instead of a grill, it didn't have that smokey flavor that street tacos usually have. † I'd definitely recommend trying out this meal for lunch or dinner because the only real cooking you have to do is with the chicken. You don't even have to season it because Trader Joe's has already done all the work for you! After this experience, I'm interested in trying out the different varieties of marinated meats that Trader Joe's offers, like the Korean-inspired Bool Kogi and the Flat Iron Beef Chuck Steak.

on-the-menu,The Impossibly Convincing Meatless Burger,23-May-19,12:08 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-impossibly-convincing-meatless-burger/,"Finney's Crafthouse & Kitchen is a popular sit-down restaurant and bar located just steps away from Stern's Wharf in downtown Santa Barbara. Not only does Finney's pride itself on having 30 different beers on tap but its menu also includes the ever-famous Impossible Burger î a completely plant-based patty that tastes impressively similar to real meat. Last Saturday evening, I decided to give my sister a taste of Santa Barbara by stopping by Finney's for a beer and a bite to eat. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Although the 45-minute wait in the rain left us slightly impatient, the service was impeccable as soon as we were seated. My sister quickly decided to take advantage of the extensive beer menu, which Finney's organized into categories of fruity,ù malty,ù light,ù tasty,ù hoppyù and hoppier.ù My sister chose to go with the Finney's Mosaic IPA located under the hoppierù section, which included notes of citrus and tropical flavors. She gave me two thumbs up on its taste as well as its hoppiness.  † The food menu was also impressive in its wide variety. Along with a long list of small plates and appetizers that were nearly impossible for us to turn down, the menu consisted of woodfired pizzas, entree salads, tacos, sandwiches, burgers and desserts. Looking from left to right at the tables next to us, my sister and I were nearly drooling at the fact that everything looked good.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus When the time came for us to order our food, I could not turn up the opportunity to try their Impossible Burger, which included grilled onions, lettuce, American cheese, tomato and their house spread. If you are plant-based or vegan, make sure to ask for it without cheese. My sister chose the turkey burger, which came with cheddar cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, jalape√±os, tomato and shallot aioli spread. The only thing we found slightly disappointing was the fact that the sides cost extra. The Impossible Burger already came out to a whopping $15, so I opted not to order any. My sister, however, did choose to sacrifice the three extra dollars for a basket of fries with hers.  † As soon as they brought our food out, we both agreed that the high prices were worth it. At this point, I consider myself somewhat of a veggie burger expert but the Impossible Burger was unlike anything I have had in the past. The patty wasn't flat like the typical veggie or black bean patty but oddly resembled the appearance of a beef patty. Although it's been close to ten years since I've eaten meat, I am convinced that the Impossible Burger had the taste of a real burger down. I made my sister give her insight as a meat eater, and she admitted that it came pretty close but still tasted slightly different from the real thing. Her turkey burger was also a ten-out-of-ten hit. We ended the evening sitting across from each other, laughing at the ridiculously fast speed at which we had both devoured our meals.  † While you can definitely expect at least a half-hour wait to be seated here on a weekend, Finney's did not disappoint. The cozy vibe, oceanfront location and irresistibly wide selection on the menu will definitely draw me back for a second trip to Finney's. 
Print Yikes! The Impossible burger is loaded with saturated fat. Vegetarian does not always mean healthy.

on-the-menu,5 Ways Food Brings People Together,23-May-19,12:41 AM,['On The Menu Staff'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/5-ways-food-brings-people-together/,"The concept of sorrow is not quite as foreign as it once was, our youth long since left behind due to one hardship in our lives or another. We move through cycles of poor mental health, of accepting our circumstances and learning to heal. We eat and we reflect and we find a way to move forward. We seek out comfort the way we always do, in loved ones and in food. Making food and sharing meals with others, whether that means catching up over a simple dinner or eating at a massive celebration, is believed to lead to a happier and healthier life. Food brings us together, and here are five ways it can benefit you.  Nexus File Photo 1. It lets us stay connected. A sit-down dinner or even an ice cream run allows us to talk and catch up with our friends and family members and check in on how they are doing. It's important to keep in touch with the people in your life, especially if you're busy. It gives us a safe space to talk about our days, our ups and downs, our fears and anxieties, our joys and successes. Sharing a meal together is also a great way to maintain our relationships. It can be highly beneficial to have close people in your life to lean on throughout life's challenges. Connectedness with the people we surround ourselves with highly benefits our well-being, so be sure to take a break from your busy routine and enjoy a meal with somebody.  † Spinach Artichoke Pizza Pizza dough Pizza sauce Fresh mozzarella or ricotta Canned artichoke hearts Fresh spinach Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to the highest setting, making sure to allow the oven to heat up for at least an hour. Stretch out pizza dough to desired thickness and spoon on sauce. Place some torn mozzarella, artichokes and spinach as desired. Bake for about 10 minutes or until golden brown. † 2. It allows us to learn about food. Sharing a family recipe with a friend or trying out a new recipe together is a great way to learn about food. Learning new things helps bring people together by encouraging them to start a conversation about food and interact with each other. Making food with others is also a great opportunity to get the creative juices flowing and broaden our scope of what we can achieve with simple ingredients. By cooking and eating together, you learn more about the history of the dish you're making and simply get to enjoy your time with each other. † Garlic Chicken Bowtie Pasta 1 whole yellow bell pepper, sliced 1 whole red bell pepper, sliced 4 cups spinach 3 zucchinis, sliced into 1-inch pieces 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 lb. farfalle (bowtie) pasta 1 cup parmesan cheese (optional) Cook your pasta according to package instructions. Drain thoroughly and set aside. Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium-sized pan on high heat and cook both bell peppers and three zucchinis for two minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside when done. In the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of oil and cook the chicken breasts with the minced garlic on medium heat for 10 minutes on each side, or until the edges are opaque. Add salt and pepper to taste. Slice cooked chicken into one-inch pieces. Place everything back into the pan on low heat, and add the spinach. Add a half cup of water to the pan while mixing everything slowly.Top with parmesan cheese. † 3. We can share our culture. Culture is a big part of food and food is a big part of many cultures. You can eat traditional dishes from your own culture with your family and learn about your own heritage through passed-down recipes within your own family. Another way to bring people together through food and shared culture is by sharing a cultural dish from your family with your friends. Not only does cultural expression through food allow us to be exposed to new flavors, but it also gives us an understanding of how other cultures may deviate from our own in their cuisines. By eating together, you can become more aware of each other's cultural background and the food that comes with it. † Arroz con Leche 2 cups water 1 cup rice 1 cinnamon stick Ω can condensed milk Ω can evaporated milk Cook the rice in water along with your cinnamon stick. Once boiling, lower the heat and let cook for another 10 minutes or until your rice has softened. Add your evaporated and condensed milk, using less of the condensed milk if the sweetness is too overpowering. Let simmer until the mixture has a pudding-like consistency. Serve in a mug, sprinkling ground cinnamon over the top for added flavor. Courtesy of commons.wikimedia.org/ 4. We live longer. Sharing meals with the people you love leads to a longer lifespan because doing so gives you a strong connection with the people in your community. While sharing a meal or cooking with someone you love may seem small in the big scheme of things, moments like these are necessary in increasing our mental well-being. According to the Mental Health Organization, a 2014 study found that eating well is associated with mental well-being, as one's poor diet and overall physical health correlate with the state of their mental health. Of course, eating healthy is super important, but having emotional support from those around you is vital for living a healthy, long life.  † Peach Mango Smoothie 1 cup peaches 1 cup mangoes 1 banana 1 cup orange juice º tsp. turmeric º tsp. ginger Add ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Add as much or as little ice depending on your temperature preference. † 5. It gives us comfort. When you're feeling down, what's better than talking about it to your friends or family while eating some delicious food? Sharing food with a friend during times of trouble not only nourishes our bodies but also our souls. Sometimes all we need is a meal that just hits the spot and takes us away from any emotional turmoil we're having, and it's really comforting to have someone to share that meal with. † Broccoli Cheddar Soup 3 cups chicken stock 2 cups chopped broccoli florets 1 cup diced onion Ω cup heavy cream 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese 1 tbsp. butter 1 tbsp. flour Heat and stir butter and flour together in a saucepan over medium heat until slightly golden. Whisk in the chicken stock, and then add in the chopped broccoli, diced onion and heavy cream. Add in shredded cheddar cheese when the onions are tender and remove the saucepan from the heat when the mixture begins to simmer. Remove from heat and serve in a bowl.  † Food helps us find our way closer to each other, as we gather together to prepare a meal and sit down for dinner. In these moments of uncertainty, it is the familiar feeling food brings that offers the most comfort. Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,State Street's Goa Taco: What a Great Place to Go,30-May-19,12:47 AM,['Shelby Guy'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/state-streets-goa-taco-what-a-great-place-to-go/,"State Street is home to many wild and unique dining options, from Brats to ramen and more. Few know, however, that there exists a taco place with an unconventional twist sitting right under their noses. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus Goa Taco, located at 718 State St., is a gourmet taco restaurant founded by Duvaldi Marneweck, a South African native and Australian-trained chef. Since it opened in 2017, this storefront has stayed strong, thanks in no small part to their delicious food, comfortable interior and welcoming staff. The crown jewel of Goa Taco, however, has to be their paratha taco. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus The signature of Goa Taco, the paratha is a deep fried, flaky Indian flatbread that acts as the taco shell. These buttery food parcels are filled with a wide variety of unconventional taco ingredients, from slow roasted pork belly to paneer cheese to five-spice confit duck.  This reporter decided to head out to see if this paratha taco was truly worth the trip. Upon arrival, I discovered that the taco may indeed live up to the hype; customers at every single table had a golden brown, flaky paratha shell î so I decided to try one for myself. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus I ordered a chicken chorizo taco with a brussels sprout slaw and fontina cheese in, of course, a paratha shell. The entire order came out to about $9.24, a bit pricey, but I was willing to see if it was worth it and I have to say, it may just be.  The chorizo was cooked perfectly, with a peppery bite at first, then a savory meatiness that ended with the heat of the chorizo sitting on the lips afterwards. The slaw was mixed with the cheese, which had melted to a perfectly creamy consistency. The slaw cooled the mouth so that the peppery chorizo did not overpower the dish. Finally came the paratha, which truly was a buttery folded piece of heaven if ever one existed. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and bready on the inside, allowing it to soak up the excess meat juice from the chorizo.  All in all, Goa Taco is an amazing place to eat, if you are ready to spend a bit more money for the paratha it is on the pricey side. Although its portions were not enough for an incredibly filling meal, Goa Taco is nevertheless a great place if you are in the mood for a snack and willing to splurge a little. ††

on-the-menu,Fair Trade America: Guilt-Free America,30-May-19,12:49 AM,['Michelle Wan'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/fair-trade-america-guilt-free-america/,"When it comes to buying chocolate, most people look for the big brands, such as Hershey's, Godiva and Ghirardelli. However, purchasing from these companies supports unsafe and unhealthy working environments that enforce illegal labor tactics. Many people do not know that behind all these big chocolate brands are children working in dangerous environments. Fortunately, there is a better way to satisfy your chocolate cravings without feeling guilty: Buy fair trade chocolates!  Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus What is fair trade? Fair trade is a movement of farmers, workers, businesses and consumers working to create justice in our global supply chain. This movement gives small farmers, workers and fishermen a voice in the workplace and community. It also ensures that they are earning enough money †to invest in their lives and their work. In addition to helping the farmers, workers and fishermen, fair trade focuses on environmentally friendly farming practices by prohibiting especially harmful chemicals and taking measures to maintain the beauty of this planet.  † What does this have to do with chocolates? Many people are unaware that, due to climate change, cocoa trees are facing danger. Unfortunately, due to high demand for chocolate, large companies look the other way and continue to harvest cocoa trees using unsustainable practices. Fair trade companies ensure that their products have been sustainably harvested and the trees have been grown without the use of harsh fertilizers and pesticides. Besides environmentally friendly farming, fair trade companies also focus on safe and healthy working environments. According to a study published by Tulane University in 2010, over 1.8 million children work on cocoa farms in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Usually, these children are foregoing †an education to work in these harsh, life-threatening environments. Fair trade companies make sure that cocoa farms are sustainable and that they prohibit child labor.  Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus Where can I buy fair trade chocolates? Although big companies like Nestl√© and Hershey's are working toward reducing child labor and improving cocoa communities in West Africa, this process will likely take a long time; therefore, it is better to start buying fair trade. This link provides a list of fair trade chocolate brands that are available for purchase in local stores. Luckily, as Gauchos, we do not need to go far to find fair trade chocolates. The Isla Vista Food Cooperative supplies several fair trade chocolate brands with a variety of flavors. So, the next time you want to purchase some chocolate, consider the negative effects that may result from your purchase, head down to a local store and look for the Fair Trade Certified seal to enjoy some guilt-free chocolates.  Although this article focuses on fair trade chocolate, fair trade practices extend to other products, such as clothes and home goods. For more information on the fair trade movement and other products, feel free to visit the Fair Trade Certified website and FairTrade America website.

I usually make Japanese curry when I don't have time to make elaborate meals because all you have to do is throw a bunch of ingredients in a pot and let it cook. I get my Japanese curry from Asian markets like Nikka Japanese Market near Trader Joe's or the Oriental Market on Hollister Ave. I like the brand Vermont Curry because it's sweet and so delicious! This brand is sweeter than the others, as the sauce contains honey, apples and cheese. This sauce is also thicker than the other brands.The packet of Japanese curry comes with more than enough curry paste so you can just use however much you want to make, but I usually use half. Here's all the other ingredients you'll need: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions (Recipe adapted from pickedplum.com): Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I usually make this recipe for dinner and eat it with rice, and I store the rest in the fridge for a quick lunch. You can substitute or add any ingredients you want, which is what I love about this recipe. In addition to eating it with rice, I also like to pair it with some udon if I want to change it up. Overall, Japanese curry is just a really simple meal that I'd recommend to any busy college student.† Comments are closed.

Not only does summer signal a time for the start of a three-month break from school, it also means that the best fruits are finally in season. With summer arriving in less than a month, it is time to switch out those apples and bananas for some strawberries and watermelons! And thankfully, our very own Isla Vista Food Cooperative has these fruits ready for us to enjoy. Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus On May 15, a table was set up in the Demo Corner of the Isla Vista Food Co-op displaying a variety of fresh fruits for students to enjoy. Visitors had the opportunity to taste-test pieces of yellow watermelon, strawberries, blueberries and mangoes with yogurt.  † The Yellow Watermelon Tired of eating the same red and green watermelons? Now, you have the opportunity to switch it up with yellow watermelon! Although a different color, its taste is still the same: sweet and crunchy. Since it is not peak watermelon season right now, the watermelon on display was not too sweet. However, the presenter mixed the watermelon with some Tajin seasoning. The seasoning, giving a tangy and spicy flavor that enhanced the sweetness of the watermelon. The flavor mixture tasted amazing and is highly recommended.  † The Berries Next to the watermelon were the strawberries and blueberries. Visitors were given small cups filled with berries. Both fruits were perfectly sweet and delicious. According to the presenter, the strawberries and blueberries were from Frecker Farms down in Carpinteria, a local and organic farm.  † The Mangoes  Unfortunately, when I arrived at the Demo Corner, the mango and yogurt samples were gone. However, the presenter gave me some advice on what kinds of mangoes to buy. The mango in the picture provides a good color to look for when buying mangoes. Additionally, the several markings on the mango are completely fine. The picture provides a good representation of the ideal mango to look out for in stores.  † Like the strawberries and blueberries, all of the fruits in the Isla Vista Food Co-op are brought in from local and organic farms. This means that while you are relishing the best fruits, you are also supporting small, local farms and healthy farming practices.

You did it, and what better way to celebrate your new degree than sharing a delicious meal with your friends and family? The On the Menu staff has curated a special list of all the different food spots for all you grads out there. Whether you're looking for something more casual or something on the upscale side, there's a place here for you!  † Outpost One of Goleta's best hidden brunch spots is located just inside the Kimpton Goodland Hotel. This is the perfect spot for a heartwarming family brunch without making the trek downtown and facing excessively long waits. Outpost offers an intimate setting with both indoor seating along with a full bar and outdoor courtyard seating that is very dog-friendly.  While the menu is pretty short in length, it offers a wide variety of different brunch cuisines, ranging from the typical egg plates to nutritious salads, yogurt bowls and the classic pancakes or french toast. I especially appreciate their wide selection of coffee beverages, even though these are not included on the physical menu itself. The almond milk cappuccino is especially satisfying. Another major plus of enjoying brunch at Outpost is their famous mimosas for all celebration purposes. If you're looking for an intimate, enjoyable setting to celebrate graduation, I definitely recommend taking your loved ones to brunch at Outpost. † Casa Blanca Located in the heart of downtown and home to endless baskets of chips and salsa is Casa Blanca, a perfect place for large parties to dine at. Whether you're going for lunch or dinner, this incredible restaurant offers a variety of authentic Mexican cuisine with options for almost any dietary restriction. Their prices may be a little higher than your typical Mexican restaurant, but the quality of the food does not disappoint!  I personally recommend ordering one of their fajita dishes, which come out fresh off the grill along with warm tortillas of either corn or flour. Casa Blanca is also home to an extensive tequila bar with various margarita flavors to enjoy. If you are really in the mood to splurge, their homemade guacamole simply cannot be matched. Casa Blanca is the perfect restaurant for spending a little extra cash on some delicious food with your family and friends.  Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Zaytoon Another upscale restaurant downtown that offers a great atmosphere for celebration is Zaytoon. This restaurant offers both Lebanese and Middle Eastern cuisines in a comfy outdoor courtyard. The seating area is surrounded by greenery and creates a calming setting for all its customers. The menu itself also offers many healthy options and vegetarian dishes.  Their organic hummus and pita bread is a must-have when visiting this restaurant. In addition to bringing out your entr√©e, the waiter will also bring additional pita bread for the table to share. Zaytoon is a cozy restaurant that provides a peaceful setting for catching up with loved ones as well as fantastic food for the whole family to enjoy.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Stella Mare's Let's say you and your family are looking to splurge a little for a graduation celebration because, let's be honest, you deserve it! Stella Mare's is the perfect place for you. This fantastic restaurant is located right by the Santa Barbara Zoo next to the bird refuge and has been serving French country bistro cuisine for almost 20 years.  They have amazing weekly offers like Bistro Tuesday, which includes their Prix Fixe Bistro Dinner Menu, and on Wednesdays they feature live jazz music. Their portion sizes are very generous, and all their dishes, whether it is an appetizer, entree or dessert, will not disappoint. Stella Mare's is a perfect restaurant for a classy, relaxing dinner for you and your family. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus On the Alley If you're looking for something more low-key than a traditional sit-down restaurant, head to the Santa Barbara Harbor. You can enjoy some beautiful views of the ocean, and while there are some exquisite waterfront dining options, On the Alley offers a casual outdoor dining experience perfect for larger families who want some tasty, inexpensive seafood that hits the spot. On the Alley has all kinds of food you'd expect from a traditional American seafood restaurant, such as fish and chips, clam chowder, burgers and tacos. I'd definitely recommend the fish and chips because it's such a classic dish, and the fish is perfectly crisp while retaining the moisture of the fish itself. The fries are well-seasoned and cooked just the way you'd want your fries to be. If you're looking to eat something more unique, try the crab cake burger. It's a nice twist on the traditional beef patty, and although the texture may be a little weird at first, the amazing flavors definitely make up for it. All the burgers come with their house-made potato chips, or you can substitute the chips with fries for an additional cost. Overall, this is the perfect spot to just chill by the oceanside and enjoy some classic American seafood. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Santa Barbara Fish Market Santa Barbara is known for its seafood, so why not take your family to eat some of the freshest seafood in town? Although this isn't an actual restaurant, it's one of the best places to get fresh and delicious seafood for a very reasonable price. They have weekly specials on their fish, which is fresh from Santa Barbara or imported from around the world. Yelpers rave about their uni and oysters, which they claim is to die for. They have a fee to cut the fish into sashimi slices for you, but when it all adds up, you get an enormous amount of fish. The salmon and ahi tuna both taste extremely fresh. I could definitely imagine bringing this home and setting up a nice seafood platter with sashimi and uni.

on-the-menu,Good Eats at the Santa Barbara Public Market,8-Jun-19,10:13 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-08/good-eats-at-the-santa-barbara-public-market/,"Over the weekend, I felt like I deserved a study break and decided to head over to the Santa Barbara Public Market with my boyfriend to relieve my stress and find some new food to try. The public market is in downtown Santa Barbara, only one stop after the Transit Center for those of you who take the bus. The market has a subtle-looking exterior, but when I opened the door, I was greeted by the lively sounds of people chatting and the savory smells from all the different restaurants. The public market reminded me of the Anaheim Packing District, an upscale food court with local vendors and bars, but it was half the size.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I did a quick walk-through of the entire market to decide what to eat. The first thing that caught my eye was the Empty Bowl Gourmet Noodle Bar, located right in the middle of the market. However, the line looked way too long and I was already pretty hungry. I walked a little further into the market and I immediately caught a scent of smokey meat and barbeque sauce.  Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The smell was coming from Soul Cal Smokehouse, and after scanning the menu, I decided that this was the spot. My boyfriend and I opted for the BBQ sampler platter, which came with a chicken drumstick, a quarter rack of baby back ribs, four ounces of brisket and pulled pork, some slices of pickles and two slices of toast. We also got potato salad, coleslaw and BBQ beans as our sides to complement our meal. The meat had that signature smokey barbeque flavor and nothing was too dry, but the chicken was just mediocre in flavor. Everything else was delicious and it was even better with their barbeque sauces: coffee BBQ, mustard BBQ and beer BBQ. All of them were amazing and paired perfectly with the meat. As for the sides, they were okay but nothing too special. The only gripe I have with this place is their portion sizes. The BBQ Sampler Platter we ordered says that it feeds two to four people, but if my boyfriend and I hadn't ordered the sides, we wouldn't even have been full. Other than that, the food was delicious. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus After eating that, we stopped by the ice cream place I had been eyeing since we came into the public market: Rori's Artisanal Creamery. They have a lot of unique and fun flavors and all of their ice cream is organic, which is a plus! We got The Worksù which is two scoops of ice cream with any toppings. We chose honey lavender and malted milk ball as our flavors and we went crazy with the toppings, as we requested whipped cream, cereal, pecans, toasted coconut flakes and more. I loved that the honey lavender ice cream had a refreshing flavor while the malted milk ball was more creamy. It was reasonably priced and I would definitely come back to try other flavors. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus We were about to head out, but my boyfriend insisted on trying Enjoy Cupcakes. It was right next to the ice cream and it was super cute, so why not? We got the Stop Flirting with Meù cookie and a cookie dough ball. The cookie dough ball tasted just as you'd expect it to taste, but the cookie was a complete surprise. I unwrapped it from the bag expecting just one cookie, but it was two huge cookies sandwiching a vanilla, mousse-like filling. The whole cookie sandwich was half-dipped in chocolate. I definitely bit more than I could chew off with this one, as it was good, but extremely sweet and we had to save the rest of the cookie for later. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Overall, I enjoyed everything I tried at the public market and I'd love to come back to try all the other food places, as some of them weren't open. I'd definitely recommend this for those who are tired of I.V. food or have guests visiting î it's a super cute and trendy spot with a bunch of different options for anyone who visits.

on-the-menu,Restaurant Reviews from International Students,21-Jun-19,5:40 PM,['On The Menu Editor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-21/restaurant-reviews-from-international-students/,"This week, we have a special addition to our On the Menu section. A group of international students from Professor Briana Westmacott's Linguistics 12 course has shared their local restaurant reviews. Linguistics 12 is a writing course for multilingual students. These international students have highlighted their favorite restaurants spanning from Isla Vista all the way to downtown Santa Barbara. We hope the reviews send you to new eating spots and give you great tips on what to order.  † Blackbird by Alex Su Over the past year studying at UCSB, I've visited many well-known restaurants in the Santa Barbara area. While there are some fast and cheap restaurants in Isla Vista, Santa Barbara also has many more expensive and luxurious restaurants that offer premium experiences, with my favorite being Blackbird located right across the street from the pier in downtown Santa Barbara.  Blackbird is a restaurant in the Hotel Californian, which is an expensive place to stay. With that type of luxury, its restaurants are, of course, a little costly. However, I'd say that Blackbird offers the best food and service even among others at a higher price level in Santa Barbara.  The design of the restaurant is stylish and provides for a luxurious feel. When you walk in, a host will greet you at the front door, take you to your seat and leave you with brand-new menus. Blackbird has seasonal plates that vary by a little every day. The best food I've had there is duck breast and grilled pork chop. The duck breast comes in a big white bowl, and the pinkish duck is soaked in a good amount of rare sauce that fills the center of the bowl. It was the best thing I've ever had. The grilled pork chop also hit me like a bomb. To be honest, I am not a big fan of pork chops, but I only ordered it because I did not want cinnamon chicken î I hate cinnamon. The porkchop really surprised me; I never thought that pork would taste better than chicken or beef.  I've also tried grilled salmon, wagyu beef, octopus, lamb and many other delicious dishes at Blackbird; they all surprised me. Like many other restaurants, it has steak that is well-prepared and tastes delicious, but it is not as mind-blowing as the other dishes. If I were to give one tip for eating at Blackbird, it would be to try something you've never had before; this restaurant will surely surprise you. For more information, you can visit their website here:†https://www.loc8nearme.com/california/santa-barbara/blackbird/4985368/ Lao Ma Tou Hot Pot by Yitong Zhou I am not picky about the food I eat. My parents know this very well. Thus, they haven't been worried about the food I am eating in America. They believed I would become accustomed to the food here quickly, and I did. Many of my friends do not like to eat the food in our dining commons, and they even grew tired of the restaurants in Santa Barbara. However, I have found a good spot that I love. After I came to UCSB, I tried nearly every restaurant close to the school. I have also tried some restaurants in the market place and downtown. The one I like the most is called Lao Ma Tou, which is located in downtown. Lao Ma Tou is a restaurant that is famous for its hot pot, which is one of my favorite foods from China. One of the reasons that I like it is because it can give me a sense of home. Usually, when my family and I are having hot pot, we sit around a table with the pot in the center. This restaurant has the same layout. Therefore, it is very homey and gives me a warm feeling. In addition, the hot pot is very similar to what we have in traditional Chinese restaurants. Thus, the taste is very good. Moreover, it has good service. All the waiters and waitresses are very kind and devoted to serving every customer. As a result, due to the wonderful taste and service and the familiar feeling of home, Lao Ma Tou is the best restaurant in Santa Barbara. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Boba Anyone? by Tiffany Langarde People who know me well know that I love all kinds of food. I always bring snacks with me that I eat between each of my classes or during my training sessions. I am passionate about cooking; I often search the internet for new recipes or snack ideas. Since I eat every day in my dorm cafeteria, I rarely go out to eat. I do not see the point of eating elsewhere since I love the variety of choices the dorm offers buffet-style. When I first arrived at UCSB, my friends introduced me to bubble tea. I had never tasted it before, and even though I found the bubbles at the bottom of the drink rather strange, I gave it a try. From the first sip, I knew it would become my new favorite drink. Since that day, I always order a slushy one with the bubbles on the bottom. I vary the flavors: honeydew, passionfruit, mango, strawberry, lychee or peach.  I have tried several places in Isla Vista looking for the best bubble tea , and I realized that they are all very good. Bubble tea is now my tradition to celebrate the end of a quarter, a Gaucho victory or a birthday or as a reward after a long day of training. It is refreshing and unlike a soft drink; the bubbles at the bottom of the cup make me feel like I am eating and drinking at the same time. It's a revolutionary concept! Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus Sushiya Express by Aurora Liu Personally speaking, Sushiya Express is the best restaurant in Isla Vista. There are several other good restaurants in Isla Vista, but not all of the food in these restaurants is delicious. Every dish in Sushiya is perfect. I have tried the sashimi, sushi, tofu soup, troop pots, kalbi, chicken soup, army stew and ramen in Sushiya, and all of it was fresh and good. The kalbi and army stew are even better than what I've eaten in China. Although the restaurant name includes Express,ù the food is not fast-food quality. In addition, this restaurant not only provides Japanese food but also some Korean food, too. The owner of Sushiya is Korean, and the chef is Japanese.  What I like the most about Sushiya is the service. The woman who owns the restaurant is nice, and she knows me very well because I have been there many times. We always chat, and she asks me if there are any new good restaurants in Isla Vista. We are friends now, and she often gives me extra cheese, extra noodles or drinks for free. All in all, Sushiya Express is fantastic! It has perfect food quality and service. I would recommend starting a conversation with the restaurant owner and telling her that the food is delicious, and then you will get a new friend.

on-the-menu,A Simple Guide to the Best Pre- and Post-Workout Snacks,27-Jun-19,12:48 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-27/a-simple-guide-to-the-best-pre-and-post-workout-snacks/,"Whether you're looking to work on your summer body or simply seeking self improvement, exercise can be one of the most rewarding things for both your mental and physical health. However, one of the most difficult parts about working out can be choosing healthy options to eat before and after. It can be extremely discouraging when you finally get to the gym only to feel run down by what you ate prior. It can be equally as frustrating to finish a great workout only to be stuck not knowing what to eat and eventually choosing something unhealthy. As a solution, here are some of the easiest and tastiest pre- and post-workout snacks that will help you get the most out of exercise.† Pre-Workout Snacks: The first thing I consider when choosing a pre-workout snack is how it will make me feel when I start exercising. I generally turn to light options that I know will keep my hunger at bay as well as keep me feeling energized for an hour or two.† 1. Protein/nutrition bars:† This one may seem fairly obvious when looking at pre-workout snacks. Nevertheless, I still find that grabbing a bar on my way out the door is the most convenient and reliable option. In order to make sure you are picking the most beneficial nutrition bars, it's always important to look at the ingredients beforehand. Many popular brands coat their bars in sugar or high-fructose corn syrup which actually works against your body when you go to exercise. Some of my personal favorites are RXBars, L√§rabars and GoMacro bars simply because they all taste great and have very minimal and clean ingredients.† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus 2. Iced coffee with almond milk: While this one is not technically a snack,ù it is a necessity to my pre-workout routine. I have always been a coffee advocate and enthusiast, but over the years I have found it is a great way to keep my energy up in my workouts. In order to not feel weighed down, I make sure that I drink mostly black coffee with just a splash of almond milk. I personally prefer iced over hot coffee before I begin a workout.† 3. Banana with nut butter: Bananas are a great source of potassium and they are vital in avoiding muscle cramps before a lengthy cardio session. One of my go-to snacks before I exercise is a banana with nut butter of your choice. I usually go with almond butter, but any natural peanut butter, sunflower seed butter or cashew butter is equally as satisfying. I strongly advise making sure you pick one with only nuts in the ingredients considering many name brands include extra ingredients like palm oil, cane sugar or corn syrup solids.† 4. Granola: If you are craving something sweet before your next workout, this is one of the most guilt-free options that will satisfy your craving. I like to choose brands of granola that contain minimal ingredients such as rolled oats, dried fruit, nuts or seeds. At the moment, my personal favorite is Nature's Path's organic dark chocolate and red berry granola. You can choose to eat it over milk like cereal or just straight out of the bag. † Post-Workout Snacks:† In contrast to my pre-workout options, I like to take advantage of more substantial snacks eating following my workouts in order to best re-energize my body. Most of the following options are high carbs and protein to aid in muscle recovery.† † Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus 1. Dried fruit and nuts: One of the most simple snacks to enjoy after a workout is fruit and nut mixes. I personally love the combination of almonds and dried cranberries. It's equally beneficial to enjoy just one or the other. Raw and unsalted almonds or dried mangoes are great snacks to keep on hand as well.† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus 2. Rice cake with nut butter: After burning lots of calories, it is extremely important to get healthy carbs and fats. A great way of doing so is spreading nut butter of your choice on a rice cake. Although rice cakes are fairly light, they manage to keep you feeling full and quickly satisfy hunger. Nut butter is also a great source of protein as well as fat that can aid in muscle gain. You can also choose to add sliced fruit on top for more flavor.† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus 3. Whole wheat toast with avocado: Who doesn't love avocado toast? Fortunately, this trendy snack also has great nutritious value following a workout. One of the best things about this option is it is completely customizable. You can choose to stick with the classic mashed avocado over toasted bread or you can add toppings like sliced tomato, seasoning, balsamic drizzle and many more. My favorite is adding a pinch of pink Himalayan salt and Sriracha on top. When choosing your bread, I advise looking at whole grain or whole wheat options. Ezekiel bread can be found at most grocery stores and contains purely sprouted grains. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus 4. Hummus and vegetables: Hummus is not only one of my favorite ways to make eating veggies more exciting but also a great source of protein. Sabra is a company that provides a wide variety of different flavors of their classic hummus. Each of their options pairs well with bell peppers, baby carrots, celery and cucumber.† 5. Smoothie bowl: If I'm looking for a meal after a workout, my absolute favorite option is making a smoothie bowl. Surprisingly enough, you don't have to drop excessive amounts of cash to get your hands on an a√ßa√≠ bowl. I have found that the easiest way to make your own bowl at home is to purchase frozen a√ßa√≠ packets and blend them with water or milk. I always choose to add a scoop of vegan protein powder and a handful of spinach or kale in my bowls for extra nutrition. Some of my favorite toppings include granola, sliced fruit, cacao nibs, almond butter and agave syrup. If you're looking for something on the lighter side, a smoothie is always a great option as well.† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Next time you find yourself at a loss for ideas on what to eat before or after a workout, make sure to refer to some of these choices. It's just as important to keep your body properly fueled as it is to exercise!

on-the-menu,Oustanding Oakland Eats,3-Jul-19,12:51 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-03/oustanding-oakland-eats/,"One of my favorite places to eat at when I visited Oakland last summer was Marufuku Ramen, so I had to try it again when I took a trip up to the Bay Area last week. Marufuku is a cozy, contemporary restaurant that serves ramen, rice bowls and an assortment of different alcoholic beverages. I knew this place would be packed, so I got on the Yelp waitlist right when it opened, and my wait time was already 45 minutes.† To pass the time, my friends and I walked along the street the restaurant was located on because it had a ton of other cool food spots and quirky stores. After 30 minutes of waiting, we were pretty hangry,ù especially since we had just arrived from Los Angeles after a six-hour drive. We stumbled upon a casual cafe, Cholita Linda, that served an array of Mexican food. We decided to grab a quick bite while waiting for our table at Marufuku Ramen, and this place really did not disappoint. We each ordered one Baja fish taco, which seemed like its most popular item.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The tacos were amazing with the crispy fried fish, crunchy cabbage slaw and light crema on top. I really liked that the portions were generous, as I had to take huge bites just to finish my taco. Cholita Linda is a great place to have a casual lunch or dinner while catching up with friends, and I'd definitely come back to try their other menu items. In the end, I was kind of glad that Marufuku Ramen had such a long wait time because I stumbled upon this amazing taco spot as a result. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Right after finishing our little appetizer at Cholita Linda, our table for ramen was ready. Marufuku's menu is incredibly simple, which I appreciate because it shows that it focuses on perfecting the quality of a few dishes rather than putting moderate effort into a vast assortment of dishes. It only had four options for its ramen, and I went with the Hakata Tonkotsu DX which came with a rich pork broth, two types of pork belly, a soft boiled egg, green onions, mushrooms, bean sprouts, corn and seaweed. You can choose the level of spiciness for your ramen, and there's a container of spice on every table just in case you want your broth to be even spicier. The ramen was pretty pricey since it had so many ingredients, so I decided to share it with a friend, and we just ordered a plate of extra noodles so we'd both be full. Now, I've been to plenty of ramen places, but this place has got to be one of my top three favorites. The superstar of this ramen is its broth. You can tell that Marufuku has spent so much time and effort perfecting it because it is just the right balance between being too watery and too creamy and you can really taste the pork flavor that also coats itself around the ramen noodles. The combination of the broth, noodles and various toppings hits the spot, making this bowl of ramen the ultimate comfort food.† Overall, Marufuku Ramen was the perfect place to dine at after an extensive drive up to Oakland. Although the wait is long, it's definitely worth it, and I'd say both of these places are must-tries if you're ever in the area.

Whether you're looking for a satiating meal, a post-workout drink or even a midnight snack, they can be the perfect option.

on-the-menu,Bon App√©tit: A Food Review of Disneyland Paris,29-Jul-19,1:21 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-29/bon-appetit-a-food-review-of-disneyland-paris/,"As an ardent Disneyland lover, I had to pay a visit to Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios in Paris while studying abroad in Europe. I reserved an entire day to explore both parks, and since the Disneyland and California Adventures in Anaheim is home to infamously delicious snacks like the turkey leg, lobster nachos and Dole Whip, I expected nothing less from the Disney Parks in Paris. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I arrived an hour after the park opened and expected to find lots of cute, trendy brunch places to eat at, but almost nothing was open yet. The only place actually serving food was a small, counter-service bakery filled with French pastries and sweets. I got the chocolate-filled mini beignets. Although I was in the mood for a savory breakfast, these beignets were exceptional. The dough was fluffy and light, and the chocolate center was just the right amount of sweet. It was like one step up from the regular Mickey beignets back at home. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus My friend and I walked around the entire Disneyland Park looking for somewhere to eat lunch because a lot of the menu options were pricey, and we felt like we could do better than opting for quick-service pizza and pasta. We eventually settled on a barbeque spot, and we each got one order of barbeque chicken wings and shared fries. The wings were flavorful, but it was a bit too much, as the sauce was slathered across the wings and it was hard to finish my meal without gulping down water in between bites. While the wings may have been too salty, the fries were the complete opposite. It's common to eat unsalted fries in France, so I didn't expect much flavor, but these fries were almost tasteless. However, a quick fix would have just been to dip the fries in the sauce. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus One thing I'd like to point out about the snacks at Disneyland is that there aren't many options. I'm used to seeing an abundance of fun, character-themed snacks and beverages at Disneyland in California, but most of the stands only sold the same assortment of ice cream and bottled beverages. After walking around for a while, we found a crepe stand in Adventureland and shared a Nutella crepe. I appreciated that it was made fresh right in front of us and was placed in a cute little Disneyland-branded crepe holder. The crepe was thin and sweet, and its warm temperature made the Nutella melt a little î which made it even better. It was the perfect snack to grab in between rides. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus We headed over to Walt Disney Studios, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a greater variety of food options than in Disneyland. They had a food event that was reminiscent of California Adventures' Food and Wine Festival, called Le Rendez-vous Gourmand. There were different stands across Walt Disney Studios and each stand represented a different European nation or region in France. We tried the mini churros from the stand representing Spain; they came in a paper cone and were dusted with powdered sugar. I often find that the Disneyland churros back at home are too sweet and fried, so these ones were amazing. They were only lightly fried and the subtle sweetness of the powdered sugar gave them a refreshing flavor. It was a great snack to share, and these churros definitely beat Anaheim's. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus For dinner, we wanted to eat at the Bistrot Chez R√©my restaurant themed after the Ratatouille movie, but it was completely full for dinner. Instead, we got savory crepes from the stand represented by Bretagne, France. The crepe had mushrooms, ham and cheese, but the crepe batter itself was different than the crepe we had before, and it wasn't really for me. It was almost gray in color, which was offsetting. The filling kept falling out of the crepe itself which made it really hard to eat, and the flavors of the entire dish itself were just lackluster.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Although I ended my trip to Disneyland Paris on a disappointing note, I still really enjoyed some of the other snacks I tried. Overall, if I hadn't visited during the Le Rendez-vous Gourmand food event, I would have been really disappointed in the snack options at both parks. My final verdict is that Disneyland Paris really knows how to perfect sweets and pastries, but its savory food is nowhere near as good as the Disney Parks back home.

on-the-menu,The Inside Scoop on McConnell's New Summer Ice Cream Flavors,19-Aug-19,12:00 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-19/the-inside-scoop-on-mcconnells-new-summer-ice-cream-flavors/,"In the midst of this summer heat, stopping by McConnell's on State Street is a must. I'm a sucker for their Sweet Cream and Earl Grey Tea & Shortbread Cookies flavors, but when I saw that they had a new summer collection, I had to try it. McConnell's teamed up with their partners to release three limited-edition flavors for the summer: Wild Sweet Clover, Honey & Cornbread Cookies and Olive Oil & Salted Almonds. Although they all sounded very unique and delicious, I only had the stomach room for a single scoop, so I chose to try the Wild Sweet Clover and the Honey & Cornbread Cookies. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The Honey & Cornbread Cookies flavor was my favorite between the two. McConnell's uses wildflower honey from the hives in San Marcos Farms and mixes it with sweet cream to create the base ice cream flavor. To top it off, they fold chunks of their housemade cornbread cookies into the ice cream. I was pleasantly surprised by how subtle yet delicious this flavor was. It reminded me of the Sweet Cream flavor as it was very milky and the honey flavor came through little by little with each spoonful. The cornbread cookies did a great job at giving this scoop some texture, although I wish the cornbread flavor was a bit stronger. Overall, this new flavor felt like a fun spin on their traditional Sweet Cream ice cream, and I would definitely get it again. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I've never heard of any ice cream flavor remotely similar to the Wild Sweet Clover, so I knew I had to try it. It's described as distinctly sweet & vaguely vanilla,ù and I thought this description was spot-on. McConnell's collaborated with Regalis Foods to create this flavor, and although it definitely reminded me of vanilla, it also had hints of an herbal flavor, hence the name clover.ù This was less milky than the first flavor I tried, which I liked because it was more refreshing and fitting for a hot day.† It's a shame that I didn't get to try the third flavor of the summer collection, but based on these two that I did try, I'll bet that it's just as fantastic. McConnell's never fails to disappoint, so I'd hurry and try out these flavors before the summer ends.

Luckily, produce delivery services like Plow to Porch are here to serve our community with organic, pesticide-free groceries that make it more convenient to eat quality meals on a time crunch.† Photo Courtesy of Plow to Porch According to company owner Pam Plesons, Plow to Porch's mission is to simplify the purchase of local fresh organic/pesticide free produce and other local foods in order to inspire good nutrition, support local farmers, protect our environment and make eating healthy food easy and affordable for everyone.ù It all starts with weekly or biweekly box subscription packed with fresh fruits, vegetables and other ingredients based on seasonal availability. The box also conveniently includes easy-to-follow recipes to go along with the ingredients so you can focus your attention on school instead of stressing over meal planning. Plow to Porch also offers all kinds of add-ons to complement your box, such as eggs, sustainable meats and even fair-trade coffee and teas. While it can be tempting stock up on instant ramen and energy drinks to get through your days, it's important to always remember to take care of your body by eating real food, and Plow to Porch can help you do so. Eating real food can help you maintain good health and a high quality of life since it is loaded with the vitamins and minerals you need to stay healthy and it even reduces the risk of disease. Fresh produce is also generally lower in sugar and higher in fiber and healthy fats than most processed foods. Another great thing about opting for fresh, real food is that it's good for the environment. Food production takes an extreme toll on the environment, but we can do our part to help the planet by supporting sustainable agriculture, as this reduces energy needs and decreases the amount of waste production.† There's also an assumption that processed food is cheaper than fresh food, but that actually isn't true. Buying real food costs less in the long run, as an analysis of 27 studies from 10 countries found that eating healthier food costs about $1.56 more than processed food per 2,000 calories. Though this amount may not seem like much, it definitely adds up, so you could save money and have a healthier diet by buying and eating real food. Photo Courtesy of Plow to Porch In addition to providing a convenient method to maintaining a healthy diet, what makes Plow to Porch such a great option for students is that they offer a variety of different box sizes and themes, so you can pick the perfect box of produce that will accommodate your needs whether you're cooking for one or eating with all your housemates. It can be overwhelming to shop at a big supermarket with rows and rows of different products, so Plow to Porch simplifies all of that for you.† In addition to the variety of produce options that they offer, Plow to Porch's website is also extremely informative and easy to navigate. It tells you exactly what you should be expecting in your box each week and where the items are sourced from. Their team also publishes a detailed newsletter with photos and recipes to help you with your meal planning even more. Check out what was in their boxes this week and the recipes that were included. † Produce:† † Recipes: † So start this school year with a healthy mindset and diet. You'll get great quality ingredients while making a difference by reducing your carbon footprint.

on-the-menu,Don't Let the Dining Commons Destroy Your Eating Habits,23-Aug-19,12:00 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/dont-let-the-dining-commons-destroy-your-eating-habits/,"One of the biggest adjustments that comes with starting your first year of college is eating in the dining halls. It can be overwhelming to first walk in and see all of the different stations full of buffet-style meals. However, don't let this new atmosphere get the best of you. In the first few weeks, eating in the dining halls can seem almost like a vacation. There's no one telling you what not to eat, no obligation to cook or prepare anything yourself and no limit to your portion sizes. For many first-year college students, this can be a recipe for disaster when it comes to health.† Photo Courtesy of commons.wikimedia.org The way in which the dining halls are laid out makes it easy for many people to be less mindful about what they are putting in their bodies. In fact, with almost every meal offered, some of the dining halls often serve a variety of unhealthy options like pizza, fries and some type of dessert. While these junk food favorites are great in moderation, most people can admit they didn't eat them for every meal prior to coming to college. Yet the luxury of having food premade makes it easy for many students to fall under the trap of heading straight to the options they know they will enjoy, even if it's not the most nutritious.† The number of meal plan options also makes it easy for students to become less mindful of their portions. At UCSB, students can choose from 10, 14, 17 or unlimited swipes a week. I remember beginning my first year assuming that 14 swipes would be the perfect meal plan for me, as it meant I'd have two confirmed meals provided a day while also allowing me the freedom of eating out or snacking. But by the end of my first month, I was already looking to change my meal plan to the minimum option of 10. Although that may sound confusing, I was realistically ending each week with at least four extra swipes. Due to my busy schedule, I'd pretty much rely on packing healthy options on the go and going to the dining commons whenever I needed a substantial meal. With that being said, whatever dining plan option you choose is ultimately up to what fits your own eating schedule.† For many people, the dining commons are a very useful source throughout the day and the 14 or 17 swipes meal plan may be suited for them. Many of the students who have extra meal swipes are familiar with the infamous DLG Late Night.ù The De La Guerra Dining Commons offers a late meal on weekdays between the hours of 9:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., which is known for its small selection of everyone's favorite junk foods.† DLG Late Night can be a great experience with friends after a long night out or when you're craving a midnight snack, but it can also be the culprit of some of the worst eating habits. Everything is great in moderation, but it's important not to make eating large portions late at night a daily activity. Studies show that meals consumed after dinner and later into the night are less likely to be burned into energy and more likely to be stored as fat, leading to health consequences such as higher levels of blood sugar, which can raise the risk of chronic disease. Unless you have admirable self control, I strongly advise against choosing the unlimited swipes meal plan if you are looking to maintain your current eating habits in college. The downside of the dining commons is it that although the meals are portioned out by each place, there's also no limit on the amount of times students can go back for more. This environment is drastically different than what many students are used to and can sometimes get the better of them. While the dining halls do make keeping consistent eating habits challenging, it is definitely possible to stay healthy. For one, I advise not becoming too overwhelmed by the plethora of junk food that is offered for each meal. It can be helpful to try and incorporate all or most of the major food groups onto your plate. This means getting enough proteins, carbohydrates and healthy fats so that you can remain energized and full throughout your day. Once you have enough nutritious value in your meal, then grabbing something a little less healthy is harmless.† Another major asset in staying healthy in the dining commons is taking advantage of the salad bar. If you find plain salads boring, there are lots of fresh produce, grains and proteins offered that you can incorporate into any meal. This is also a great place to start in order to ensure you don't fill up on unhealthy foods first.† It's also important to note that eating healthy in the dining halls does not mean you need to cut back on your servings or eat less than you did prior to starting school. It simply means not overdoing it when you see the vast amount of options offered. As long as you listen to your body and eat a balanced diet when you are hungry, it is completely possible to eat healthy in the dining commons. While eating at the dining commons may seem intimidating at first, as long as you remain mindful and consistent, you won't have a problem with maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet. It's important to consider that if you don't eat a certain way back home, then there's no reason to eat that way in college. As long as you exercise and keep nutrition in mind, being healthy in college is completely doable.

on-the-menu,A Brunch of Delightful Food at Andersen's Danish Bakery and Restaurant,29-Aug-19,3:00 PM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-29/a-brunch-of-delightful-food-at-andersens-danish-bakery-and-restaurant/,"Coming to Santa Barbara, I've realized the brunch craze is a pretty big thing to do here on the weekends, especially with the countless number of restaurants in Goleta and Santa Barbara. I decided to take advantage of my free time this summer and hit up a pretty popular brunch spot on State Street, Andersen's Danish Bakery and Restaurant.† Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus When I walked inside, I noticed that the interior of the restaurant gave off a very quaint vibe whereas its outside seating felt more modern. Because this restaurant was also a bakery, all their baked goods and pastries were displayed alongside the seating area which was nice to look at while we waited for our food. The service of this place was excellent. Our server was attentive, always checking in if we needed anything and refilling our water and coffee whenever it seemed low. She even brought out some complimentary pastries while we waited for our food, which were phenomenal.  I decided to split an order of Crab Cakes Egg Benedict as well as their French Toast with Fresh Berries with my friend as we couldn't decide between just having one for ourselves! The eggs benedict were amazing. The eggs were poached perfectly, as the yolk was not too runny or cooked. Having crab cakes as a replacement for English muffins are a game changer. I was afraid the crab cakes would taste a little too fishy for my tastings in the morning but they paired with the eggs quite nicely. My favorite part of the dish was the hollandaise sauce topped all over, as the creaminess of the sauce really tied everything together. The dish also came with a side order of diced potatoes. As for the French toast, it was pretty good but nothing that was over the top for a French toast dish. I felt like that batter may have had some hint of banana in it, however, I enjoyed it. What I will say if you decide to try this place out is to try croissant French toast instead! I never imagined croissant to be in French toast form but I was able to try my friend's and I was mind blown. The toast didn't taste dry or flaky which I expected since it was a croissant.† Overall, the food and pasties from here were pretty good. Having been to Denmark and having tried the Danish pastries over there, I would say the pastries here are pretty comparable. I will definitely come back to maybe try just the High Tea and Pastriesù experience and if you ever find yourself in downtown Santa Barbara, you should check it out as well!††

An essential part of any trip to San Francisco is the dessert. Whether you have a big sweet tooth or not, San Francisco has something for everyone. This list also includes a places that accommodate for a variety of dietary restrictions and allergies. This list is just a handful of great dessert places in SF, but does not include all of them!† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The first dessert spot on the list is Yasukochi's Sweet Stop in Japantown. This bakery is located in the Super Mira market and is cash only. Yasukochi's is known for their coffee crunch cake, which is amazing. It has been voted Best of San Franciscoù multiple times according to Modern Luxury magazine. The cake sells out quickly and the ladies working the bakery recommend getting there right when it opens to avoid the lines and the chance that you won't be able to get a slice!† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Another yummy dessert spot in Japantown is Benkyodo Co, a family operated shop that makes fresh mochi every morning. Since mochi is made from rice flour, it is gluten-free and many of their flavors are vegan. The shop is also cash only and closed on Sundays. Their menu changes with additions of seasonal flavors and their popular flavors sell out quickly, so it is best to get to the shop early to see all of what they have to offer.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus In the nearby Mission district, Bi Rite Market serves some of the best ice cream in the city. They have a variety of unique flavors and use ingredients sourced from local farmers from the Bay Area. Bi Rite also has a variety of gluten-free and dairy-free options for those with dietary restrictions. This ice cream shop is one of the few places in SF that offers gluten-free cones.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Many people walk over to Mission Dolores Park, which is across the street, to enjoy their ice cream and people-watch. Another hidden gem in the mission district is Stonemill Matcha. Stonemill Matcha is a cafe that offers a full brunch/lunch menu and incorporates matcha into all of its drinks and desserts. They offer a variety of drinks such as hojicha matcha, ginger matcha and yuzu matcha. Their pastries are made on-site and are known for being very aesthetic looking. Although they do not have many vegan and/or gluten-free options, one of the workers mentioned that they are planning on expanding their menu to do so. Stonemill Matcha almost always has a line but the wait is worth it.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Across the city in the Sunset District, Golden Island is a Chinese cafe that many locals frequent. Golden Island is known for their sago desserts, which are small clear starch balls that are boiled and served with sweetened coconut milk. Sago can be served cold or warm. The customer is able to customize fruits or other add-ons such as sweet tofu, boba and red bean. One of the most remarkable things about Golden Island is that its desserts are not overly sweet or heavy, making it perfect for any time of the day.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The final place on this dessert guide is Souvla, a Greek restaurant that has multiple locations within the city. Souvla is home to the best Greek frozen yogurt that I've ever had in my life. The flavor is reminiscent of a plain tart frozen yogurt but better. There are four flavor options available but the baklava one is the best. The workers are always very generous with the portions so the $5 serving could be easily shared.†† † Although this concludes my SF dessert guide, there are hundreds of other places that serve great sweets. I hope this guide helps you find a new favorite the next time you visit the city!

on-the-menu,Get Hooked on Santa Barbara's Locally-Sourced Fishery Program,19-Sep-19,12:19 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/get-hooked-on-santa-barbaras-locally-sourced-fishery-program/,"Cooking with ingredients like fish, mussels and clams may seem intimidating, but considering that Santa Barbara is one of California's most abundant sources of marine life, it would be a shame if you never took a full dive into incorporating fresh seafood into your diet. Thankfully, the people at Get Hooked Seafood, a community-supported fishery program, are here to help you achieve a healthier and more environmentally-friendly diet. Photo Courtesy of Get Hooked Seafood Get Hooked Seafood was founded by Kim Selkoe and Victoria Voss, who formed their team of UCSB alumni to work with local fishermen in order to provide access to local sustainable seafood for the community. They have both had an interest in the ocean throughout their lives and decided that they wanted to take a more practical and educational approach to work with fishermen and restaurants make choices about their seafood. They've partnered up with the Commercial Fishermen of Santa Barbara and Real Good Fish CSF in Moss Landing to bring fresh seafood to their members at various pick-up locations in the Santa Barbara and Ventura areas. Get Hooked Seafood wants you to feel directly connected to your community and your food source,ù according to Voss. When you eat our seafood you don't just have a piece of fish on your plate. You know exactly who caught it, the methods used to catch it and information about the species.ù† What makes Get Hooked Seafood different from simply buying fish at a grocery store or subscribing to meal prep delivery services is that the processing methods as well as the meat itself is more sustainable and healthier for your body. Eating seafood is a small way to make a difference in the environment because it has a smaller carbon footprint than other animal proteins, such as beef or chicken, since fishing wild-caught seafood does not require farmland or taking care of livestock. Get Hooked Seafood also uses significantly less packaging than typical delivery services and grocery stores, as members simply pick up their seafood in one plastic bag from an ice chest at their pick-up locations. Additionally, traceability is a huge issue in the seafood industry, as opportunities for fraud are increasing and as a result, grocery stores and restaurants may serve fish that is not actually the species that is advertised. Get Hooked Seafood is a solution for that because they collaborate with local fishermen fishing out of the Santa Barbara Channel, so you know that the seafood on your plate is fresh and genuine. Additionally, since the fish is fresh from the coast, it hasn't travelled thousands of miles to get processed overseas, which lessens the environmental impacts of the seafood and retains the freshness of the fish. Seafood in a packaged box from grocery stores is usually older and has to be eaten the day after purchase, whereas Get Hooked fish is so fresh that people can cook it days later without compromising the freshness of the meat. In addition to the environmental benefits of eating seafood, incorporating seafood into your diet is also a quick and easy way to eat healthy. Fish is packed with important nutrients such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, which are crucial for optimal body and brain function and strongly linked to a reduced risk of many diseases. Fish is also considered one of the most heart-healthy foods, as it is strongly linked to a lower risk of heart disease and strokes. It's important to think about the long-term effects of what you are putting into your body, and seafood definitely has great health benefits. Photo Courtesy of Get Hooked Seafood Despite these great environmental and health benefits, some are often turned off by seafood because they have the misconception that seafood is difficult to prepare and cook. This is not true at all and this misunderstanding may come from the fact that people are simply unfamiliar with seafood. In reality, cooking with seafood is actually very convenient, as you don't have to marinate it and it can be baked or fried, just like other types of protein. It's also great for those who are short on time. The recipes that Get Hooked Seafood provides on their website for their fish only take 15 minutes at the most, and they've conveniently included a few recipes per species. Additionally, there is a great diversity of seafood options from Get Hooked. Santa Barbara has the advantage of cold water climate from north and warm water climate from the south, which brings bring tropical and cold water species to give a great abundance of seafood types. This allows you to be adventurous by trying new and different seafood varieties, but you can also opt out of some types of seafood if you just want to stick to the basics. The way Get Hooked Seafood works is that you simply select the quantity of fish you want, choose between whole or filleted fish, pick a weekly or bi-weekly schedule and then find a pick-up location that is convenient for you. This fall, Get Hooked is coming to Isla Vista to expand their services. Members will be able to pick up their seafood from the Isla Vista Co-op, making this a super convenient option for students to eat more healthy and environmentally-friendly.

After hearing so many of my friends rave about this place, I decided to check it out. I went to their Goleta location right in the Camino Real Marketplace which is perfect for many carless college students like me since you can just catch the 24x or 27 to take you straight there. However, they do have four other locations in Santa Barbara, Westlake Village and Oxnard.† Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus I really loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, it was a mixture of something comforting but also a little bit fancy. There's an outside patio with more of a modern decor that you walk through to go into the restaurant, but once inside it gives off a more authentic, traditional Mexican feel. At this location it was an order at the counterù and then you choose your table and your food will be brought out by the number given to you at the counter. What is nice about the outside patio is that it's in the part of the Camino Real Marketplace where there's almost some sort of stage with some type of performance always going on. When my friend and I went, there was a small performer playing so we were able to hear some free music and enjoy the typical SB lovely weather outside along with our meal.† Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus I decided to order the Burrito Mojado with steak which was their popular wet burrito as well as their Los Agaves Salad that was topped with oranges, mangoes, avocados and their homemade balsamic dressing. As soon as we sat down we were given chips and salsa and just a little while after came the rest of our food. The service was very quick and friendly. The servers there always came around checking if everything was all right with our meal and very attentive whenever we needed something. As for the food, one of my favorite parts of this restaurant was their self-serve salsa/condiments bar they had on the inside because I kept going back for more. My friend and I tried all their salsas and thought they were all very good. You can really tell that they used fresh ingredients, especially when tasting the pico de gallo. The portions were worth the price you pay for. My friend and I were extremely hungry that day and we didn't even finish the entire meal. I could not get enough of their burrito with their wet sauce. Their steak was also quite tender and cooked very well. My favorite part of their salad was the addition of the mandarin oranges and mangoes as they added a nice tangy flavor that pairs nicely with everything else. †Overall, the food was phenomenal and I know I'm definitely coming back for more to try their famous Agaves Enchilada. If you ever find yourself needing to pay a trip to this shopping plaza for maybe groceries or to watch a movie, definitely find some time in your schedule to grab a bite to eat at this place and I promise you won't regret it!

ROOST is the perfect place to take your friends or significant other if you're looking for a classy dining experience before the summer ends. I decided to give this restaurant a try with my significant other after shopping at Paseo Nuevo, and it definitely exceeded my expectations.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The exterior of the restaurant is tastefully subtle and the interior is just the same, featuring a robust selection of local and imported wines and artwork from local artists. We were seated immediately and given ample time to look over the menu. ROOST offers dishes featuring seasonal ingredients such as rotisserie-roasted meats and vegetables, fresh salads, seafood and steak. I ordered the tagliatelle, which was a pasta dish consisting of pesto, rotisserie chicken, roasted peppers, arugula and parmesan cheese. My significant other, on the other hand, decided to try the braised pork roulade, which was cooked with apple, onion, fennel, herbs and mustard-braised leeks. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I was hesitant to order the tagliatelle dish because I was afraid it was going to be too heavy, but it was actually just right. The arugula gave the dish an earthy, aromatic feel and the rotisserie chicken made the dish really unique because it was extremely flavorful compared to other pasta dishes that I've had before. The portion was perfect because it was just the right amount to fill me up, but it didn't make me feel groggy like I usually do after I eat other pasta dishes.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I also tried some of the braised pork roulade, and it actually ended up tasting even better than my dish. The pork was so tender that it felt like it melted in my mouth and the flavor was phenomenal. The flavor from the mustard-braised leeks came through in the vegetables and mashed potatoes, which gave it a nice contrast to the savory flavor of the meat and creamy potatoes.† † Overall, this was a great meal to end my day. The food was exceptional and the ambience of the restaurant was a nice, calming break from the busy shopping center in Paseo Nuevo. I'd definitely come back to try more menu items because they were so simple yet deliciously made.

on-the-menu,Mr. Bossom: Inventive Korean Comfort Eats,26-Sep-19,12:02 AM,['Rachel Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/mr-bossom-inventive-korean-comfort-eats/,"Calling all pork lovers! Here's a restaurant that's serving a pork dish that will make you wish you hadn't tried it because you won't stop craving it afterward. Mr. Bossam is a popular chain restaurant in South Korea that specializes in serving a popular Korean dish, bossam, which is thinly sliced pork belly that has been boiled in spices and served with side dishes. The way of eating this dish is usually to have the pork and side dishes wrapped in some sort of vegetable leaves which is where the dish's name comes from, as ssamù in Korean literally means wrapped. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus I've seen pictures of dishes from this restaurant for years on my social media and have been dying to try it! I was finally able to check out both the Los Angeles Koreatown location and the Rowland Heights location because it was just so good the first time that I had to have it again the very next week.† Their menu has a broad selection of foods; however, most people come here for their choices of bossam dishes as well as the popular grilled cheese pork ribs. The pork ribs are so popular that the dish has been covered by Insider as well as the Los Angeles Times. This dish consists of grilled pork ribs covered in their sweet gochujang sauce on top of a bed of mozzarella cheese. It's served in a cast iron skillet, so by the time your order comes all the cheese has melted all over the pork ribs. The skillet also comes with sausages, a spicy rice cake and a steamed egg. Their servers help cut the ribs up and show you how to wrap the cheese around to eat it. The meal doesn't end there because the chefs will turn any of your leftovers into fried rice by adding complimentary rice, seaweed and an egg! Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus However, my favorite dish by far was the bossam. I was able to try three kinds: green onion and gochujang, original and garlic. If I had to pick a favorite I would definitely choose the garlic one, but I think the other two flavors were quite good as well. The garlic one stood out to me the most because it was on the sweeter end, which I enjoyed. The green onion and gochuchang has a kick from the gochujang so I would go with that if you like a little heat. If you can't decide on a dish to order, I would recommend that you go with their All Star Bossam Combo which offers all three flavors! All these dishes come with a wide variety of side dishes that are also refillable. Make sure to make a wrap that has all their side dishes because it really enhances the flavor. I really enjoyed their fish cakes and radish paper with the pork. Their bossams can easily feed two to three (and maybe even four) people so make sure you go with a group. For those of you who are over 21, bossam is a common meal to eat with a drink, so if you're up for it, share a bottle of soju or Korean rice wine with your table.†† The first time I went I was also able to try their seafood and green onion pancakes appetizer which I would definitely recommend if you think you have the appetite for it. I always love Korean pancakes so I knew this would be a good choice. Overall, I had a wonderful time during both visits to this restaurant. The servers are very accommodating but are always running around so don't be afraid to use the buzzer at your table to get their attention. The food is excellent so if you ever find yourself making a visit to LA (or maybe even Korea) check this place out!

Santa Barbara Shellfish Company sits right on the end of Stearns Wharf and provides customers with a casual spot to enjoy ocean views and munch on fresh and well-prepared seafood. When you get to the restaurant, you're already immersed in the beachy atmosphere with the ocean breeze and smell of seafood. I arrived with my friend around lunchtime and there was a waitlist to be seated, but it moved really quickly, as we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Although the interior of the restaurant is quite small, the coziness of the space gives it a more personal tone that is true to Santa Barbara culture. We were seated at the bar and given menus immediately, which had a really nice array of seafood options including unique local ingredients such as Santa Barbara rock crab, uni and abalone. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus My friend and I opted to share the crab sandwich and shrimp ceviche. The sandwich was served on sourdough bread with coleslaw and onion rings on the side and the shrimp ceviche was served with a side of warm tortilla chips. The portions were huge and great for sharing, and they did not skimp on the meat at all. The crab salad in the sandwich was extremely refreshing and the crispy onion rings created a nice balance of flavors. Although this dish looked very simple, it definitely packed a punch.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The shrimp ceviche was also another very refreshing dish with its tangy flavors. There wasn't anything super special about it, but I appreciated that it was simply a satisfying appetizer. The ingredients were obviously very fresh and everything in the ceviche was evenly coated with the lime juice and pico de gallo.† This was the perfect amount to share, as my friend and I both felt satisfied and not too full for a walk on the beach afterwards. This was my second time visiting Santa Barbara Shellfish Company and it did not disappoint. I appreciate how consistent the quality of their seafood was between my two visits and I think what really makes this restaurant stand out from the other seafood options in Santa Barbara is that you know you're getting quality food at a fair price.

on-the-menu,Hearty Home-Cooked Pesto Gnocchi,26-Sep-19,12:49 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/hearty-home-cooked-pesto-gnocchi/,"When you're having a long day, all you need is a soul-filling bowl of pasta. Sometimes, though, spaghetti and meatballs just doesn't do the job, so why not try something new? This recipe will give you a dish that tastes gourmet at a fraction of the price and effort. Best of all, it'll make you feel super satisfied without even adding any meat in it. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients:
1/3 cup pine nuts
1/2 Parmesan cheese, grated
6 cups basil leaves (about 3 bunches)
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 package Trader Joe's gnocchi Directions:
1. Toast the pine nuts on a pan for five to seven minutes until fragrant and golden brown in color. Transfer the pine nuts to a food processor and let them cool.
2. Pulse pine nuts until finely grounded.
3. Wash basil leaves and pluck the leaves off the stem. Add the leaves into the food processor and pulse again.
4. Add grated Parmesan and olive oil to the food processor and pulse for approximately one minute until the mixture is mostly smooth then set aside for later.
5. Cook the gnocchi in lightly-salted boiling water for three minutes. Before draining, pour a little bit of the pasta water into a large mixing bowl. Drain completely.
6. Put the gnocchi into the mixing bowl and add a few tablespoons of pesto to the bowl. Stir until everything is thoroughly mixed and all the gnocchi is coated with the pesto sauce. Although this simple dish is fantastic on its own, try pairing it with burrata cheese as a side. Burrata is made of fresh mozzarella cheese with a solid outer curd with soft cream inside. All you have to do is cut it halfway through and top it with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a sprinkle of kosher salt. This is completely optional, but it'll elevate your meal even more. So what are you waiting for? This is a perfect dinner to make when you're craving something hearty but don't want to spend an excessive amount of time prepping and cooking.

These recipes can be made quickly or ahead of time and use minimal ingredients. My sugar- and oil-free granola is super easy to make and makes your kitchen smell amazing! Store-bought granola is often pricey and has a lot of added sugar. To ensure that it stays crunchy, make sure the granola cools completely before storing it.

2 cups of rolled oats
Ω cup of mixed nuts

To celebrate the change of seasons, Goleta decided to once again celebrate with the 28th annual Goleta Lemon Festival this past weekend.† Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus The festivities began on Saturday, Sept. 28, which drew in a crowd of over 250 people to Girsh Park next to the Camino Real Marketplace. This reporter attended the second day of the festival and had, quite honestly, a mixed experience. The festival, though free for all visitors, held more boutique stands and place centers than food stalls. Of the food stalls available, less than half of them catered to the theme of the festival. Of the few lemon-themed items, only a small selection peaked interest. I began with the lemon-flavored churros, priced at $5 per churro, which had a surprisingly sour note upon first bite. The churros themselves had a perfectly crispy outside and a warm bready center, but this was overpowered by the lemon sugar dust covering it, which began sour then slowly morphed into a sweet candy coating. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus Next was the all-too-important lemon cotton candy, a personal favorite. This billowy delight had the perfect mix of cotton candy sweetness, with just a hint of lemon. The only downside to the cotton candy is that it began to quickly unravel in the windy weather. For $3 a cone, this treat was a fun festival highlight. Shelby Guy / Daily Nexus The final treats of this day were the lemon meringue pie and lemonade. The pie, which was priced at $4 a slice or $15 for a whole pie, made the festival worthwhile. With an immaculately perfect whipped and toasted topping that elevated the saccharine lemon curd, this pie was well worth the wait in line.† The lemonade, however, left much to be desired. For $5 for a large, the lemonade was more watery than expected. The strawberry variant, which consisted of only a handful of cut-up strawberries in the original for a dollar more, had the same watered-down taste.† The 28th annual Goleta Lemon Festival had its triumphs but seemed to be more of a festival to celebrate Goleta than the lemons it produces.

on-the-menu,Have You Gaucho Mojo Back?,3-Oct-19,12:56 AM,"['Winnie Lam', 'Rachel Lee']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/have-you-gaucho-mojo-back/,"Isla Vista's favorite teahouse is finally back with their grand opening! Not only did Mojo move locations from Trigo Road to Seville Road, but they also changed their name from Mojo Teahouse to Mojo Asian Fusion Cafe. Their transition from a teahouse to a cafe means that they came out with a variety of new food that they didn't have during their soft opening. The new additions include kimbap, cheese tea and new options for rice bowls. Rachel Lee / Daily Nexus The new Mojo location has all their tables indoors, as opposed to the previous location's patio, which we kind of missed. Nevertheless, it was definitely nice to order and sit down in a more spacious area because it was always packed inside the old location. We decided to try a half order of The Faker, which is kimbap, a Korean rice roll that was made with imitation crab meat. When we opened the box, we didn't expect there to be so much sauce on top of the kimbap, as it was drizzled with so much sauce that we could barely see the rolls themselves. The rolls were kind of difficult to eat because they fell apart when we picked them up with a fork, but as for the flavor, it wasn't too bad. We're fairly certain that we got tuna kimbap instead of the imitation crab kimbap that we ordered, but it was still pretty tasty and not dissimilar to other kimbaps we've eaten in the past. Our only gripe was the excessive amount of sauce that was drizzled across the top, so if you're not a fan of sauce we'd recommend that you ask for the sauce on the side or just skip out on it altogether. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus We also wanted to try something they had during their soft opening so that we could compare if anything got better or worse, and we settled on the Pork Belly Bowl. While the kimbap was too saucy, the rice bowl was on the other end of the extreme. Though the braised pork had a nice savory flavor, it was a little too dry for our taste. A quick fix would be to go up to the counter and get yourself some sweet and sour sauce, but we would've preferred if they just put more soy sauce on the pork itself. The rice was well-cooked and paired nicely with the pork, but we didn't enjoy the mustard vegetables on the side. Usually, people don't like mustard vegetables because of the sour taste, but we have no problem with that. The thing that made the vegetables difficult to eat was that it vaguely tasted like dishwater, so we just ate the pork and rice. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus As for drinks, we tried the House Jasmine Green Milk Tea with boba and the House Roasted Oolong Milk Tea. We got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea with 50% sugar and it was still pretty sweet, but that could have been because of the boba. Overall, we thought it had a nice floral jasmine flavor and we could actually taste the tea, which is something I thought was lacking during Mojo's soft opening, as the drinks back then tasted like they were made with a lot of syrup. We noticed while we were heading out that they had a trash can specifically for their used tea leaves, and we appreciated that we could see that they weren't skimping out on the quality of their tea. As for the oolong milk tea, the tea flavor wasn't as distinct as we would've liked it. We got it with 30% sugar, and it tasted pretty watered down. It wasn't too bad, but we were pretty disappointed because oolong is such a staple tea. Overall, it's worth your time to try out the beverages at Mojo's grand opening. As for their food, although it is at a fair price, just keep in mind that some things may be too saucy or too dry, so just make adjustments based on your personal preferences. Unfortunately, their full menu hasn't come out yet, as we are still waiting on their blended drinks and tapas to arrive at this new location. But until then, definitely stop by Mojo for a quick boba fix!

Theater, you couldn't have missed Sizzling Lunch's huge vibrant menu on their storefront windows. Sizzling Lunch replaced 212 Hot Pot and although the interior may look the same, Sizzling Lunch brought a Bay Area favorite to Isla Vista with its adaptation of teppanyaki, a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I've visited the restaurant twice since its opening, and both of my experiences were extremely pleasant. What makes Sizzling Lunch stand out from other food spots in I.V. is not only their delicious food but also their exceptional service. After my friends and I were seated, our waiter was happy to give us recommendations and was very attentive even after we got our food. I appreciated that there were photos that corresponded to each menu item for those who might not have had teppanyaki before. At Sizzling Lunch, the teppanyaki is comprised of beef, chicken or salmon with black pepper rice, udon noodles, golden curry or teriyaki sauce. Each dish comes with rice or noodles, meat, a small selection of vegetables and a ball of butter. The meat doesn't come fully cooked but since plate is extremely hot, the customer is supposed to mix and cook all ingredients together themselves and complement it with the side condiments like chili powder, garlic shoyu and teriyaki sauce.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus During my first visit, I tried the curry beef rice with cheese. Overall, I thought the beef, rice and side sauces paired perfectly together, making it a great meal to grab with friends. The only thing I don't like about it is the anticipation you get when you're waiting for your food to stop smoking and cool down a bit because it seriously makes you sit there and salivate. The portion sizes were very reasonable for the price, especially in I.V. It does remind me of fried rice that I could easily make by myself at home, but the novelty of eating this dish from a sizzling plate and the convenience of how fast the food comes out makes eating at Sizzling Lunch worth your time and money. The second time I visited I wanted to try something different, so I decided to order the beef udon. This dish came with almost the same ingredients as the rice plate I ordered during my first visit, except with udon noodles instead of rice and without curry powder. I also thought it was really savory and tasty, but I'd say that I like the rice plates better just as a personal preference. Something that I noticed is that I didn't really taste a difference from when my dish had curry powder and when it didn't, so if you're debating between the curry beef udon and the regular beef udon, I'd just go for the regular and save a bit of money while you're at it. After trying Sizzling Lunch twice, I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. Though it seems like such simple dishes, they truly are delicious and the staff makes you feel welcome by always checking up on you. The curry beef rice with cheese is a must-try dish, and condiments like the garlic shoyu and chili powder are necessary if you want to maximize the flavor of your dish. Since it just opened up, Sizzling Lunch is pretty packed during peak lunch and dinner hours, so I'd recommend going during less busy times, especially if you're planning to eat with a large group of people.

Even if the weather in Isla Vista hasn't changed, the local coffee shops and grocery stores have started to provide new and exciting fall items. If you're anything like me and don't understand the hype about the pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks, here are several other seasonal favorites you can try! One of the more underrated coffee chains in the Goleta area is the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Not only do they have an entire seasonal menu packed with fall drinks, but their pumpkin spice is arguably better than Starbucks'. Their cold brew is a particular standout and is definitely worth the short drive.† If you're in the mood for a sweet option during the fall season, Trader Joe's is stocked with various health-conscious options. This mix is perfect for an October movie night with friends and can be easily modified to fit dietary restrictions. These cookies are the perfect treat to enjoy with friends! Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus My favorite snack during the fall has always been caramel corn. Boomchickapop has the perfect option that is vegan friendly and guilt free. It is just the right amount of both salty and sweet and can be enjoyed at any time of the day Nothing quite says fall to me like a warm chai latte. One of the most popular and convenient ways to make chai at home is to buy a packet of tea bags at the grocery store. I personally like Teavana the best and like to customize my tea however I like. If you want to make a latte, you can easily add in milk of your choice along with espresso shots or a pinch of cinnamon for an extra taste of fall.† Although these famous instant oatmeals packs are sold all year-round, they make a perfect quick and easy fall breakfast. They are best paired with toppings like cinnamon and sliced Fuji apples during the fall. This is a great option that doesn't sacrifice health for its taste! Even though the leaves might not change and the days are still reminiscent of the summertime, there's no reason to skip out on the fall season in I.V. this year. Simply head over to your local grocer or coffee shop and treat yourself to some of these delicious fall snacks to get into the holiday spirit! Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,Isla Vista Food Cooperative Makes Strides in the Community,17-Oct-19,12:43 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/isla-vista-food-cooperative-makes-strides-in-the-community/,"The Isla Vista Food Cooperative has been a local favorite in the community since its establishment in 1972. Not only is it an entirely customer-owned grocery store, but all of its extraneous profits are redistributed into renovating and improving the store itself. For the 2019-2020 school year, the Co-op has made many exciting changes to further its goal of serving the needs of the community and focus on its environmentally friendly values. Melissa Cohen, the general manager of the Co-op, notes that the store is especially unique in that it is the only co-op in the country that is mostly owned by college students and also happens to be one of the oldest on the West Coast. The Co-op began in hopes of connecting the Isla Vista community more directly with its local farmers. According to Cohen, people wanted to have a place they could trust and a place that was there to ensure their values about food and production labor rights.ù† Another feature that makes the Isla Vista Co-op so central to community outreach is its focus on catering directly to customer needs. Cohen explains that customers have a very important voice in deciding what appears on the shelves. If you don't see something on the shelf that is working for you, just ask us,ù she said. In fact, just to the left of the front door, there are comment slips of paper where customers can request products to be provided. Cohen says she not only reads every single one, but odds are we will stock it for you as long as it aligns with what we have currently.ù† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus For instance, the recent changes to the Co-op's deli reflect its preference for sustainable ingredients. The produce sold in the deli section is always locally grown, not only to ensure customers can purchase the best quality possible, but also so local farmers receive the most profit for their work. Food justice does not necessarily mean everyone having quick access to food; it means that the producers also have a livelihood,ù Cohen said.† Food justice and support for local farmers are two very important values at the Co-op, especially considering Santa Barbara County is one of the largest agricultural-producing counties in the country. Many of the Co-op's local connections today have been with them since it began business 47 years ago.† Cohen believes that her first job as a sandwich maker at the Co-op provided her with the fundamental skills the Co-op still uses in its sandwich-making today; the only difference is the way it now chooses to package them. The journey to adopting compostable packaging techniques at the Co-op has not been easy. When the Co-op first attempted to use plant-cellulose packaging, Santa Barbara County advised against it due to its strikingly similar appearance to plastic which complicated the recycling process.†† The Co-op has recently made strides by partnering with Vegware, a new type of paper-based and easily compostable packaging. These environmental efforts are reflected within UC Santa Barbara, which now has yellow bins throughout campus where the new packaging can be easily disposed of. All of the waste deposited in these bins is then taken to a different compost center in the county. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Though the compostable packaging is certainly groundbreaking, there are also exciting store products, including the Co-op's homemade hummus.† Unlike many local grocers, the Co-op's hummus is completely unpasteurized, there is no heating element in the production process and the recipe uses olive oil rather than canola oil. While these practices make the shelf life shorter, the taste is more organic. Along with its original hummus, the Co-op also makes its own vegan cream cheese that is featured in its most popular deli item, the Best F#$@%*! Wrap. Not only is this wrap vegan-friendly, it also features ingredients that reflect the Co-op's value of organic ingredients. Cohen stressed, It's a relationship in each sandwich. It's a combination of all these hands in the local community coming together.ù† To further encourage buyers to take advantage of its organic produce, the Co-op also carries conventional items like non-organic rice, beans and pasta. By including these inexpensive items, customers will have more freedom to fill their carts with fresh and locally grown items.† The Co-op's exciting new developments go beyond the store's interior î the variety of colorful patio tables out front create a welcoming space for community interaction. This improvement to the outer appearance of the store was a conscious decision in order to create what Cohen refers to as social infrastructureù.† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Social infrastructure builds the social capital that builds the social systems that build community. Food co-ops are just one way this happens because of the great spaces they create,ù she explained. These patio tables now provide a place for people throughout Isla Vista to strengthen their social relationships with one another, regardless of demographic. The most special aspect of each of these innovations is that they are all directly funded by people who joined the Co-op during the past owner drive. Once you join, Cohen explained, you can get an investment share and receive numerous benefits. In fact, this share is always refundable in the hopes that if the investor leaves, he or she will use their profit to start another co-op in their next community.† If partial ownership at the Co-op is something that sparks your interest, the owner drive is happening throughout October. In addition, the Co-op's annual owner meeting is coming up on Nov. 9. All co-owners will be served a free dinner and Jon Steinman î author of the book Grocery Storyù î will be the keynote speaker. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus The constant innovations being made at the Co-op reflect its dedication to bringing a sense of community to all of Isla Vista, regardless of income level. For many people, it is impossible to leave Isla Vista to go to a grocery store out in Goleta. As Cohen empathized, Everyone is an eater and at some point, we all have to get to our food at a grocery store, and we hope that we can be the ones to have people's back in those cases.ù

on-the-menu,Meal Replacement Fad: To Eat or Not To Eat?,24-Oct-19,12:38 AM,['Jennifer Sor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/meal-replacement-fad-to-eat-or-not-to-eat/,"I don't care about food,ù Anderson Cooper told the Hollywood Reporter in 2018. His intimate confession made headlines but all things considered, isn't that surprising. (This is, after all, the same man who once said, I am not good at, like, sitting on a beach. I am not good at decompressing.ù) If not food, what then does Cooper consume? Meal replacement shakes: Soylent, specifically. Fortified with 26 vitamins and minerals î which is all that humans are known to need î† Soylent is purportedly the exclusive component of Cooper's diet.† I'm trying to replace all foods with [Soylent] because it would be, like, three fewer decisions in a day,ù Cooper said.† It's no surprise that meal replacements appeal to executives like Cooper. The streamlined nature of Soylent takes the preparation, inefficiency and, as Cooper emphasized, the decision out of eating. Gone is the concern for culinary variety; Soylent powder, which only requires 13 ounces of water before consumption, is thoughtless and removes everything people find annoying about cooking. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Uncoincidentally, Soylent is in high demand among workers in high-pressure, high-stress industries. Sales are particularly high in cities like Palo Alto, San Jose and other areas of Silicon Valley.† The point of Soylent is ¶ to provide sustenance, not taste,ù wrote Keith Spencer, author of A People's History of Silicon Valley.ù Some of Spencer's research focuses on Soylent, which is considered to be Silicon Valley's flagship food item. Professor David Golumbia, who collaborated with Spencer, attributed Soylent's popularity among engineers to the drink's flexibility: It's food for people who don't have time for food.† I know exactly what to eat; I don't have to think about it,ù Golumbia added. It's a very algorithmic way of eating.ù Ah, an algorithm î is there a better way to catch the attention of a tech mogul? Elsewhere, reception to the drink isn't quite as enthusiastic. That's disgusting,ù my roommate said. I had showed up to our dorm with two Soylent bottles: one for her, one for me. That's so messed up. You don't like eating?ù I started drinking Soylent in my first month of college. People seemed to think that this stemmed from my ambivalence toward food but much to the contrary, I love eating. There was a period in my life where I would regularly dream about food. I memorized the operation hours for all my favorite fast-casual restaurants. I used to wake up in the morning and check the dining hall menu before doing anything else. They say you need to eat to live but for me, with much embarrassment, I sometimes think it's the other way around.† So, why Soylent? I could lie and say that I'm a stickler for time management, that I aspire to acquire the work ethic of a Silicon Valley engineer, but to be honest, I'm just lazy. I hate cooking. The most advanced dish I can make is spaghetti, and I can't even make that very well.† To be brutally, brutally honest? As much as I love good food, I just don't care enough to cook it, so it was only natural that Soylent caught my eye. For someone like me, someone who is so lazy she once subsisted off of granola bars for two days straight, Soylent seemed like the hail-all solution to my dietary needs. Finally, something that put an end to the haphazard grocery trips and my anguish over meal prepping. It was food when food was the last thing on my mind.† When I started telling people about my new, self-prescribed meal plan, they were less than enthused. You need to stop,ù my sister said sternly. She asked me how midterm season was faring; I let it slip that I was on my second bottle of Soylent for the day.† I can't stop.ù† It's not real food îù But I love it!ù I actually really, really, really did, although I see why she found it off-putting. Soylent, for one, is pricey. One bottle, which provides 400 calories of nutrition, costs around $5.† To put this another way, I checked my EBT spending history this month and nearly had a heart attack: $116.50 spent at the Arbor. It was a combination of Soylent and granola bars but, truthfully, it's mostly Soylent. Soylent is also commonly criticized for its taste, but my experience was the opposite. Soylent is a little bland as far as beverages go, but I couldn't help but nurse an odd affinity for its subtle flavoring which blended into the backdrop of my day. Not great, but not unpleasant by any means. (My favorite flavor, by the way? Caf√© Vanilla. Think of a Frappuccino but not as sweet.) In his 2014 interview with The Atlantic,ù Soylent CEO Robert Rhinehart conceded that the taste can be disconcerting, although he is generally unapologetic in the engineering of Soylent. He theorizes that the perception of how Soylent tastes is purely subjective. What I found is that a lot of people who like the idea, like the taste, and a lot of people who don't like the idea are repelled by the taste,ù Rhinehart said. Because it has so little intrinsic taste, it pretty much comes from your expectation.ù In other words, if you're hell-bent on eating natural, whole foods and are alienated by the concept of a meal replacement, Soylent is probably not for you.† Those who are more open to the concept of meal replacements will be more optimistic in their initial perception of Soylent. As far as I can tell, this theory rings true: While many of my friends can barely stand the look of Soylent, let alone the taste, I don't find it very offensive at all.† [When it comes to food] there's just an emotional attachment to routine and tradition,ù Rhinehart said in defense of his product line, which is expected to amass over $10 million in the upcoming year. We have technology that makes our lives better. It doesn't make sense that you would keep technology out of this very important part of life.ù† Rhinehart makes a fair point î does the adverse reaction to Soylent reflect a problem with meal replacements themselves or is it our refusal to let go of familiarity? Is Soylent controversial because it's a flawed way of addressing our dietary needs, or is it because Americans are clinging onto traditional yet antiquated eating patterns?† You'd have to consult a nutritionist, a historian and a tech startup to get a completely well-informed answer. I drank Soylent regularly for a good six months. It saved me a good amount of time from cooking and, physically, I felt fine. I still drink Soylent on occasion but have made significant efforts to cut back on my consumption, much to the relief of my wallet. In fact, I have started policing a new set of rules with myself: no replacing all of my meals with Soylent î or granola bars, for that matter. I try to only rely on it when I'm truly strapped for time, reminding myself that Soylent is, after all, a meal replacement.† It's a surprisingly hard habit to kick. I stopped by the refrigerated section at the Arbor this morning only to look longingly at the meal replacement display î before turning around and forcing myself to get my grub elsewhere. You, however, can buy a 14-ounce bottle of Soylent for $4.49 at the Arbor, or purchase it in bulk for $3.25 a serving on Soylent's website. A variety of flavors await, among them cacao, strawberry, mocha, mint chocolate (a new release!) and, of course, the original Soylent formula. I've tried all of them, but like I said, save a bottle of the Caf√© Vanilla for me.†
Print 21g fat per serving, banned in Canada for not meeting the requirements for meal replacement, Berkeley Wellness letter does not recommend it, so, yeah, seems great.

on-the-menu,Spice Up Your Autumn With Starbucks' Newest Drink,24-Oct-19,12:49 AM,['Brea Spencer'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/spice-up-your-autumn-with-starbucks-newest-drink/,"It's arguably the most basicù time of year î the season in which Starbucks comes out with its newest fall drinks and many, including myself, flock to the nearest store to get a pumpkin spice latte. Personally, I love the pumpkin spice latte. It reminds me of everything great about fall all wrapped up in warm flavor and spices, milk and the slightest hint of coffee. This year, however, Starbucks has come out with a new fall drink which might have the makings to become a new cult classic. Brea Spencer / Daily Nexus The pumpkin cream cold brew is the newest addition to the Starbucks menu, and it's making a wonderful first impression. The drink itself is topped with a layer of cream that is thicker than its typical whipped cream. It comes with a comforting welcome to it, almost like a pumpkin hug. The drink as a whole definitely holds the same flavor as the famous pumpkin spice latte; it's marked by layers of pumpkin, fall spices and the perfect amount of sweetness. Each of these flavors pairs perfectly with the cold brew. The rich cream cuts through the bitter taste of the cold brew, and the two balance each other well. I highly recommend trying it. For the sake of comparison, I tried it alongside the classic pumpkin spice latte. The pumpkin spice latte definitely had a more mellow pumpkin taste to it, and because it is a latte, there is almost no coffee flavor. It, of course, incorporates flavors of fall in its spices, but surprisingly, not very much pumpkin. As for the individual, it depends if he or she has a preference for tasting the coffee in their drink. After trying both, I must say that the cold brew definitely adds a necessary flavor level to the otherwise almost overwhelming sweetness of pumpkin that the pumpkin spice latte just does not accomplish. I still will always be a fan of the pumpkin spice latte because a warm pumpkin drink is just the key to my soul. However, the pumpkin cream cold brew has its own charm and will definitely be making itself a part of my fall drink rotation. Brea Spencer / Daily Nexus If neither of these drink options provides enough pumpkin flavor, I recommend trying the pumpkin cream cheese muffin this fall season. This muffin has all of the pumpkin flavor that I think the drinks lack. While it is rich, the cream cheese center adds a perfect addition to the pumpkin flavor. The nuts on the outside also complement the muffin really well. By itself, it may be a little too much, so I suggest pairing it with one of the fall drinks to offset the richness.† While the pumpkin flavors of fall may be nothing new, the pumpkin cream cold brew is a new take on a beloved classic, and I think it's worth a try. And who knows? This drink could only be here for this season, so get it while you can.

on-the-menu,On the Seas with the SB Harbor and Seafood Festival,30-Oct-19,4:50 PM,['Alexandra Leal Silva'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/on-the-seas-with-the-sb-harbor-and-seafood-festival/,"We arrived at 10 a.m. and the line for parking was down the street. Little kids were sitting on their parents' shoulders and the ocean breeze was flowing through the air, making it the perfect day for a festival. The Santa Barbara Harbor and Seafood Festival started decades ago but has gradually changed over time. Its latest incarnation has been happening since 2002. The original purpose of the festival was to celebrate the fishermen of Santa Barbara, complete with a parade of boats decorated for the community's amusement. It later became a fundraising effort for unwed mothers and in the 1990s the idea of a festival arose.† Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus From the moment we walked onto the boardwalk, the walkway was flooded with local vendors and creatives selling everything from paintings to jewelry, homemade candles to organic sunscreen. I've never witnessed a market scream Santa Barbaraù as aggressively as this one did. My roommates and I decided to buy a candle from the Way Cool Candles booth that was made out of a gel and that had shells and flowers set inside.† The dock was covered in food trucks and stands as far as the eye could see. There was Pearson's Cajun Food with a line that never seemed to lighten up (which made sense when you saw the incredible po'boys leaving their windows). Lobster Rolls SBYC also held strong crowds with their classic lobster roll, and the Santa Barbara classic Brophy Bros. impressed, as usual, selling their famous clam chowder for $4. Everywhere we looked, there was a plethora of food that dared us to try it. I could feel my wallet aching in my backpack and I held out as long as I could, finally giving into Brophy Bros. and getting a clam chowder that was worth every penny. The broth was thick but not floury, with large, firm potato chunks and clams that, by their smell, were clearly fresh. The chowder overall was well seasoned and was not too hot for the sunny day but still warm enough for maximum flavor retention.†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† There was music in the air no matter where you went and the festival had a stage set right in the middle of the harbor with a stream of bands playing music to keep the crowd dancing. Both young and old took to the dance floor to show off their moves.† Further down the harbor, vendors were set up selling fresh seafood: oysters, urchins and of course lobsters. The SB Harbor and Seafood Festival was originally created to celebrate the beginning of lobster season and this year was no different. Several tents had pools full of live lobsters that patrons could buy and take home. Crowds gathered to see them, kids were allowed to pick them up and they sold as quickly as they were put into the pool. According to the official SB Harbor and Seafood Festival website, the SB Harbor houses over 100 fishermen, produces 10 million pounds of seafood a year and brings $30 million dollars to the local economy. It is no wonder why they created a festival meant to honor the industry and amplify it to the local community.† One of the best parts of the whole festival was the free boat rides through the SB Harbor. Though standing in the line became agonizing due to its location right under the sun, the experience was all worth it. This is my fourth year living in Santa Barbara and I've never had the chance to experience the American Riviera as I did on that boat ride. From waving to strangers on the pier, witnessing sea lions napping and watching the sun glittering on the ocean, the SB Harbor and Seafood Festival accomplished its job of creating a moment for appreciation. At one point, a woman on the boat turned to the man sitting next to her and remarked, This is the best vacation ever.ù At this moment, I felt renewed astonishment that for me and my roommates, this was not a vacation, this was home.†

Halloween-themed donuts! Located on State Street, Hook & Press Donuts î the city's only artisan donut shop î have created new flavors for the season with fresh, local ingredients and have dressed some of their non-rotating flavors up for the holiday.† The first donut I tried was the Coastal Fog but was renamed òGhostal Fog' for Halloween. Ghostal Fog is a yeast donut with an Earl Grey glaze and adorned with a meringue ghost topper. If you're a fan of floral-tasting treats, this is the donut for you. The earthiness of the tea balances out with the sweetness of the meringue and donut, not to mention the best decorated. Next up is the Horchata Crumb donut which is another yeast donut with horchata-flavored glaze and cinnamon streusel crumb. My favorite part of this donut was the crumb. The softness of the donut and crunch of the crumb made for a perfect balance of textures. I highly recommend pairing this donut with an almond milk latte. The horchata crumb was my favorite donut out of all of the donuts I tried.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus Additionally, I had the Pumpkin Spice Latte donut. This PSL donut is far from basic! The pumpkin spice glaze is adorned with cold brew stripes which make the donut look very aesthetically pleasing. Unlike most pumpkin spice-flavored treats, the flavor of the coffee is prominent, which I really enjoyed.† On the bottom left of the photo is the Maple Coconut Bacon, which is surprisingly vegetarian! The baconù bits on the donut are actually coconut flakes that were made to resemble the taste smoky and salty taste of bacon. The sweetness of the maple glaze and the saltiness from the coconut bacon balance each other pleasantly. The taste is reminiscent of when the maple syrup from your pancakes would mix with the bacon on your plate.† Another donut I tried was the Witch's Brew donut. This donut is the classic Vanilla Bean Funfetti dressed up for Halloween. This donut is a fun spin on the famous sprinkle donut and looks great decorated with chocolate glaze and Halloween sprinkles.† The last donut I tried was the Browned Butter, which was renamed òBrown Mummies' for Halloween. This donut had brown butter stripes with candy eyes, which added a nice touch. I particularly loved how the nuttiness of the brown butter balanced with the salt placed on top of it.† These Halloween-themed donuts will only be available until Oct. 31 so don't wait too long to stop by! The seasonal flavors will be available until the end of the season but you can follow their Instagram @hookandpressdonuts for regular updates on their flavors

Luckily for us locals, Finch & Fork î† located in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara î now serves delicious fried chicken on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings. The upscale restaurant's menu consists of locally-sourced and clean ingredients that the executive chef, Peter Cham, uses to create culinary masterpieces. We had the pleasure of trying their fried chicken along with a few other dishes from their fall menu.† Photo Courtesy of Finch & Fork To begin our meal, we had each had a blackberry smash cocktail, a mocktail created with seltzer, fresh local blackberries, ginger, lime and black pepper. The mocktail was very refreshing and the sweetness from the blackberries worked wonderfully with the tartness of the lime. We also had the charred broccolini and summer squash which were both incredibly appetizing. The broccolini was cooked perfectly and complemented with a tasty nutritional yeast and miso sauce, which tasted shockingly similar to cheese, but was shockingly vegan. The summer squash was exceptional as well and was paired with a sweet yet earthy black garlic vinaigrette. For our entrees, we shared the diver scallops and fried chicken. Photo Courtesy of Finch & Fork The diver scallops were very fresh and adorned with colorful cauliflower. The scallops were cooked perfectly with the right amount of char. Although all of the dishes we ate were delicious, the fried chicken stood out the most for us. The portion was huge and consisted of a thigh, breast and wing. The skin of the chicken was perfectly crunchy and not overly greasy. The meat itself was juicy and flavorful. As if there wasn't enough delicious food on the plate, the chicken was also served with mashed potatoes and pickles. The mashed potatoes were super creamy and delicious, especially with the meaty flavor of the gravy. Along with the mashed potatoes, the pickles complemented the dish well because its hint of sweetness cut the saltiness of the other two pairings. Although fried chicken has a tendency to be very heavy, we found that Finch & Fork's was well-balanced between the flavor and texture.† Photo Courtesy of Finch & Fork To complete our meal we had the mascarpone cheesecake and sticky toffee cake. The cheesecake was one of the best we've ever had; it was light and not too sweet, which was a great way to end the meal. We also had the sticky toffee cake that came with the most delicious caramel corn and fresh whipped cream. These desserts were to die for so make sure to save room for them after your meal! So if you ever decide you want to grab a friend and try Finch & Fork's adventurous take on classic comfort food. Enjoy a mock cocktail îor a real one if you can î and have a fun time talking the night away. You are bound to have a fun chat with any of the waiters who are so kind, knowledgeable and funny. Food tastes better with good company and Finch & Fork definitely has the ambiance for nonchalant conversation. It feels like home while simultaneously being one of the top restaurants in Santa Barbara. With great food and a fun time, you can't go wrong with forking at the Finch!†

on-the-menu,Rockfire's Wing Wednesday Brings Heat to Isla Vista,7-Nov-19,12:02 AM,['Leonard Paulasa'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-07/rockfires-wing-wednesday-brings-heat-to-isla-vista/,"Do you ever feel like someone lit a match in your mouth? Well, that's exactly what my friend and I felt last week when we tried Rockfire Grill's Nashville Hawt. Rockfire Grill recently added a new deal on their already-busy Wednesday schedule known as Wing Wednesdays, serving up wings for only 75 cents apiece. The establishment offers six different flavors of wings: garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, BBQ, buffalo, honey garlic, sweet chili, Hawt Mango and Nashville Hawt, with the last wing being labeled with four fire symbols to signal its spice. Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Being Filipino, I saw the four fire symbols and questioned how hot it could really be. So I invited another spice-loving friend of mine, and we ordered five pieces of Rockfire's Nashville Hawt as well as five pieces of their garlic parmesan. Let me just tell you that Nashville Hawt is no joke. It's the type of spice that sneaks up on you, where you think you're okay, then BOOM! It took a solid 15 seconds for the spice to settle into our mouths, and my friend and I felt like we just betrayed our Asian heritage. The heat in those wings was unreal î it seriously felt like someone lit a match in my mouth. I found it difficult to gauge the actual flavor of the first wing because I was too focused on the fire burning in my mouth. Thankfully my friend and I had the insight to order beers and the garlic parmesan to alleviate some of the burning sensations. On the second piece, I was able to analyze the wing more, and it wasn't too bad. After my mouth got used to the initial heat from the first wing î with the help of about half a pint of beer î I was really able to taste the wing. While the sauce, unfortunately, took away from some of the wing's crunch, the flavor was still there. The wings were juicy on the inside and well seasoned. The sauce might have washed away some of the seasoning, but I found it was a forgivable offense since I was mostly just looking for the challenge of overcoming the heat. On the third wing, it was all there. My mouth had gotten used to the burning sensation, and it became more of a strong kick. The flavor of the wing was more noticeable as the spice levels no longer overpowered the taste. For the price and taste of the Nashville Hawt, I would definitely recommend it to my fellow spice lovers. For those of you afraid of spicy food, don't even try to taste the sauce. Overall score: 7/10 The garlic parmesan was absolutely amazing. The crunch was there, the flavors were almost perfect, the wings were juicy and the seasoning permeated through the breading and skin of the wing. The one negative thing I have to say about this wing is that it was slightly oversalted, but otherwise this wing was perfect. Again, for the price of the wing coupled with what it had to offer, I would highly recommend this wing. Absolutely perfect for your next karaoke night at Rockfire. Overall score: 9/10. My experiences with the wings and at Rockfire in general were fantastic. For 75 cents, you're definitely getting a bang for your buck, so if you have a free Wednesday night, grab some friends, buy some wings, share a couple pints and sing some karaoke.

I'm here to spill the beans on the best place to go for specialty coffee, pastries and productive vibes.† Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Dune Coffee Roasters, otherwise known as The French Press, hits all the requirements for an awesome coffee shop and let me tell you why. For starters, the coffee is delicious and they roast their own beans in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara. They have beans from Ethiopia, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala for your classic pour-over coffee. Ranging from smooth chocolate, tropical watermelon, caramelly tangerine, brown sugar blueberry and apricot cherry, there is a single-origin or blend that will make anyone's taste buds happy. You can even snag a bag of your favorite one in the store and make it at home. If coffee isn't your thing, they have great matcha (which they also sell), tea, kombucha on tap and hot chocolate. Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus But what if you need a snack break and another drink just won't do? Dune has an option for any food craving you might be having. For a savory mood, you can grab an English muffin frittata sandwich, bagels, pretzel sticks or homemade sourdough toast with smoked salmon, prosciutto, tomato, mozzarella and seasoning. For a sweet tooth, there are triple-berry scones, morning buns, blueberry muffins, croissants, yogurt parfaits with amazing granola, seasonal fruit danishes and homemade toast with almond butter and honey, butter and seasonal jam or butter and cinnamon sugar. Dune is a bakery and a coffee shop brewed into one and no one can be mad; it's the perfect blend. Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus While you're set on the food and coffee, we all know the layout of the cafe is important too. You can't sit somewhere dark for several hours without getting fidgety for fresh air and light, but this isn't a concern at Dune. It has huge open windows and outdoor seating that allows you to soak up the sun while catching up with a friend, journaling or studying for an upcoming midterm. There is plenty of space inside at communal tables, bar stools at high tables and bench seats for ultimate comfort. The bright, open, airy setup gives you so much personal space and relieves you of the pressure to rush out quickly. Take your time and enjoy the relaxed energy î you might even strike up a conversation with the person next to you. Everyone working at Dune is extremely friendly and I've had only great experiences, learning something new and having a laugh every time I've gone there.† So, there you have it î† Dune is the best specialty coffee shop in town in this writer's opinion. Grab a friend for an essay-writing date, midterm study session or a good old catch up and head over to one of their three locations on Storke Road, State Street or Anacapa Street. I promise you'll love it a latte!

In February of this year, Baked By Ber went live and began to provide fresh cookies to the citizens of Isla Vista. Baked By Ber is an online bakery owned by one of our very own Gauchos, Amber Jorgensen. As a fourth-year biochemistry major, she manages this online bakery and fulfills orders while maintaining her studies.† Photo Courtesy of Amber Jorgensen Jorgensen began baking in her freshman year of high school. Since she lived in a town with nowhere to buy good sweets, she decided to bake them on her own. Occasionally, she would post pictures of her treats on her Instagram account (@chefamb) where she received many comments encouraging her to open up a bakery. Instead, on New Year's Eve of 2018, she decided to start up a website to sell her cookies. The next day, she went on the Santa Barbara health department website to apply for a Cottage Food Operations permit and was granted permission a week later. She began to build her website and practice recipes for her website's grand openingù in February of 2019.† When the bakery was first launched, Jorgensen received a lot of orders during the first weekend which proved to be difficult to manage. As she recalls, I didn't even have a stand mixer at the time so I was doing everything by hand ¶ my biceps were sore all the time. I stayed up super late every night that weekend just getting everyone's orders done and didn't go out or do anything else.ù As a biochemistry student, Jorgensen can find it tough to balance her workloads of an online bakery and academics. However, she conquered this challenge by learning how to efficiently manage her time by consistently planning out her next day's schedule in order to keep herself accountable.† Photo Courtesy of Amber Jorgensen Because she will be graduating soon, Jorgensen is unsure of her future plans with her online bakery, so make sure to stop by her website soon and order some cookies before it's too late! Jorgensen recommends the s'mookies, as they are her personal and her customers' favorite. She also recommends the double chocolate cookies, which are really rich and indulgent,ù and therefore perfect for chocolate lovers. Oatmeal cream pies are a childhood favorite; Jorgensen enjoyed this treat as a child and claimed they totally bring [her] back to childhood,ù so be sure to order one if you're feeling nostalgic! Photo Courtesy of Amber Jorgensen I managed to get my hands on the s'mookie, double chocolate cookie, (vegan) chocolate chip cookie and gooey confetti cookie flavors. The s'mookie was an amazing experience. Jorgensen successfully takes the idea of s'mores and creatively makes a cookie out of it. I was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the cookie since it wasn't chewy like a regular cookie but crumbly, imitating the graham cracker part of a s'more. The double chocolate cookie was just as Jorgensen described it to be î† rich and indulgent. She sprinkles on sea salt to counteract the sweetness that would typically come with a double-chocolate dessert, making this cookie a perfect amount of sweet. The vegan chocolate chip cookie was interesting, since it was my first time trying a vegan cookie. Due to the different ingredients used, the cookie had a slightly different taste than regular chocolate chip cookies. Nevertheless, the cookie still tasted amazing. Lastly, the gooey confetti cookie was my personal favorite. It was soft, chewy and thick, and it just melted in my mouth. The cookie was topped with confectioners' sugar, which paired perfectly. The cookies were wonderfully delicious, and I strongly recommend sending an order in ASAP! Orders are usually completed within a week, and they are available for pickup or delivery (the latter for an extra charge) in I.V. You can change the ingredients to fit your dietary needs and/or cravings. However, if you are in need of an immediate sugar fix, you can now stop by Campus Point Coffee to grab one of Baked By Ber's cookies! Feel free to check out her Facebook page (@Baked By Ber) and Instagram account (@bakedbyber) to get updates on newly released cookie flavors!

on-the-menu,The Scoop on McConnell's Fall and Holiday Flavors,14-Nov-19,12:23 AM,['Rinah Anatalio'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/the-scoop-on-mcconnells-fall-and-holiday-flavors/,"One of the best things about the holiday season is the new releases and revivals of seasonal flavors. McConnell's î arguably Santa Barbara's best ice cream shop î has released several new flavors for the holidays. All of these flavors are made with organic, locally sourced ingredients and are available at their scoop shops and online.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus One of McConnell's new flavors is called Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate. It is a rich dairy-based ice cream made with three types of chocolate. McConnell's uses cocoa, chocolate ganache and melted chocolate chips to create this wonderful ice cream. If you are a chocolate lover, this is the ice cream is for you.† The second seasonal flavor I tried was the Cinnamon & Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. Although raisins have a bad reputation, this ice cream will change your mind. This ice cream has a milk and cream base that is infused with cinnamon and swirled with chunks of cinnamon oatmeal raisin cookies. My mind was completely blown; it made me want to apologize for always discarding the raisins that were in my trail mix. The texture of this flavor was reminiscent of McConnell's Earl Grey & Shortbread Cookies due to the thickness of the ice cream and the chunks of the cookies. If you enjoy ice cream with chunky texture and cinnamon flavor, I highly recommend this flavor.† The final temporary flavor that I tried was the Rockier Road, which has a milk chocolate base with a marshmallow swirl and walnuts. Unlike a typical rocky road ice cream, McConnell's uses a marshmallow swirl instead of using marshmallow pieces. I really enjoyed the marshmallow swirl because I felt like it was a part of the ice cream itself rather than an additional ingredient added in. This prevented it from having multiple contrasting textures from the ice cream, marshmallow swirl and walnuts. McConnell's also uses walnuts instead of almonds, unlike many other ice cream brands, which I found complemented the ice cream nicely. If you like traditional ice cream flavors, Rockier Road is for you.† In addition to its new flavors, McConnell's has revived its pumpkin pie flavor î a sweet pumpkin ice cream with hints of cinnamon, ginger, cloves and allspice that encompasses fall with its warm and cozy spices. I recommend this flavor to be eaten as an ice cream sandwich with their homemade snickerdoodle cookies to get the full pumpkin pie experience. For all my fellow pumpkin spice lovers, this ice cream is for you.† Sadly, McConnells did not release any dairy-free or vegan seasonal ice cream flavors but a worker informed me that they are hoping to in the future. These flavors are only available for a limited time, so don't wait too long to stop in!†

Maybe you don't have the money or time to shop at the grocery store, you ran out of meal swipes or you woke up too late and missed breakfast. You can visit the University Center (UCen) Associated Students Food Bank or the Miramar Food Pantry (located in the Sierra Madre Villages) to grab a quick meal or grocery items to make your own. Check out some information about how each food bank works and don't forget to try some of our recipes using the free items.† Michelle Stolzman / Daily Nexus Associated Students Food Bank The Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank is conveniently located in the UCen on the second floor, but make sure to enter through the outside. Their mission is to provide fresh, free food and toiletries. There are two requirements to use the food bank: You must be a registered UCSB student and you should complete a self-declaration of income online at https://foodbank.as.ucsb.edu to confirm you make less than $14,484 a year.† The food bank is divided into 12 categories: starch (bread, tortillas, rice, pasta), soup, sauce, beans, protein (peanut butter, canned tuna), canned vegetables, breakfast (oatmeal, cereal), instant lunch (top ramen, mac and cheese), miscellaneous (bars, chips, crackers, baking goods) and a wide variety of fresh produce, plus menstrual hygiene products and toiletries (toilet paper, soap). Produce doesn't have a maximum capacity, and besides feminine hygiene (which restricts students to three items), all other categories have a one-item max, but you can attend the food bank every day it's open!† On the A.S. food bank website you can also find more information about CalFresh, nutrition and food skills, meal tickets and the UCSB Financial Crisis Response Team as well as other food resources on or around campus. If you're interested, there are also volunteer and employment opportunities. Make sure to take advantage of this free and extremely beneficial resource, and don't forget to take your access card!† Here are some recipes you can create from some of the resources at the food bank: Nutella Stuffed French Toast Even though this breakfast looks, smells and tastes fancy and complicated, it's a very simple and indulging meal. What makes it even better is that you can get the bread and fruit used in this recipe from the food bank on campus! Impress your friends with this Sunday morning dish, and have your entire floor wishing they were as talented as you.† Serves: 4 Nutella sandwiches Ingredients: Directions: Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Miramar Food Pantry When I went on Thursday, the restock day, they had a wide variety of options. Since they have fridges, they can store more temperature-sensitive items like eggs. They have six-packs of eggs available; however it does tend to run out fast. We managed to get iceberg lettuce, butter lettuce, celery, peppers, canned corn and eggs. They do offer more options, but it is far from the main campus. Chicken Risotto The following recipe is for a simple risotto I made using ingredients gathered from the food bank. These are the general steps I like to follow, however, sometimes I like to add other ingredients like diced mushrooms or seafood! This recipe can be made using vegetable stock instead of chicken and you can omit the parmesan for a vegan alternative.

When I think of Thanksgiving, I think of Mexican cornbread, layered cheesy potatoes, lomo, honey-baked ham, dinner rolls, arroz, ensalada de manzana, japanese peanuts, green or cheesy Mexican spaghetti, ponche, gelatina and apple pie. Because I'm Mexican American, my Thanksgivings have always been filled with a few traditional American dishes and a fusion of both cultures (which to me is the best of both worlds).† Two of my favorite simple dishes to make are Mexican cornbread and ensalada de manzanas. The Mexican cornbread is a twist on a traditional cornbread recipe but because of the jalapeno, bacon and onion, it contains more flavor and texture.

on-the-menu,Calling All Coffee Lovers: The Newest Shop in Isla Vista,5-Dec-19,12:39 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-05/calling-all-coffee-lovers-the-newest-shop-in-isla-vista/,"If you've lived in Isla Vista for over a year now, you probably remember walking or biking past Coffee Collaborative, an artsy coffee spot next to Sam's To Go. Recently, this cozy spot was closed only to be replaced by a new coffee shop known as Campus Point Coffee. As finals are steadily approaching, I took it upon myself to see what this coffee shop had to offer to treat my caffeine fix. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Unlike Coffee Collaborative, which was decorated in bright and abstract colors with guitars in the corner and cozy couches, Campus Point Coffee has a much more formal setting. The interior is decorated with fairly neutral colors with a picture of the ocean where a mural once was. The tables are simple and less casual than Coffee Collaborative's setting. Nearly every table was filled with students diligently studying for their upcoming finals.† Upon looking at the menu, I contemplated ordering my typical nitro cold brew or choosing an option that was more unique to the shop. Ultimately, I chose a white chocolate latte with oat milk because I figured it was something I couldn't order anywhere else nearby. Overall, the latte was good but just a little too sweet for my liking. In addition to oat milk, they also offer other non-dairy milks like almond and soy. Other unique drinks that caught my eye were the salted caramel latte and the eggnog latte. They also offer the typical, classic coffee drinks like macchiatos, cappuccinos and lattes, along with tea lattes like matcha or chai. Another interesting option they offered was blended iced coffee drinks. Campus Point Coffee offers a variety of pastry options in the front, including croissants, breakfast sandwiches, donuts and cookies (including a vegan option). They also offer made-to-order food items including a variety of empanada options such as beef, chicken, breakfast style and vegan. Beyond their coffee drinks, they offer Italian soda, iced teas and kombucha. While Campus Point Coffee has definitely aced their job of providing a variety of options and taken on a Santa Barbara spin with its local name, Coffee Collaborative will be missed dearly. Personally, I prefer more of a closed-off and quiet coffee shop to study in when I am cramming for finals, and the bright and open atmosphere of Campus Point Coffee is not the ideal atmosphere for me. The blasting music that could be heard from Sam's next door also made it hard for me to picture myself concentrating there. I were to go back to Campus Point Coffee, I probably would choose a simpler drink to sip and enjoy as I walk to class, rather than sitting in the shop itself. Overall, this new spot is a great addition to Isla Vista; it just can't stand in the way of my love for Caj√©, unfortunately.†

on-the-menu,Vons Chicken Brings a Savory Crunch to Isla Vista,5-Dec-19,12:31 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-05/vons-korean-fried-chicken-brings-a-savory-crunch-to-isla-vista/,"If a bite of crunchy, juicy chicken hits the spot for you, then you've got to try Korean fried chicken. What makes Korean fried chicken unique is its thin, crispy skin which contrasts with American fried chicken, which has a thick crust that's often made even thicker by soaking the chicken in buttermilk. Korean fried chicken itself is not as oily as other styles of fried chicken because the skin is only lightly battered and the chicken is fried twice, making the skin very crunchy and keeping the meat deliciously moist. After frying, the chicken pieces are covered in either garlic or spicy sauces, giving customers the option to customize the flavor of their fried chicken. If this sounds like something you'd want to try, head over to Vons Chicken. Until the opening of Vons Chicken in Isla Vista, there had not been any options for Korean fried chicken in the Isla Vista or Santa Barbara area. Luckily for us, we finally get to indulge in this delicious cuisine! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus My first visit to Vons Chicken was on a weekday afternoon. I barely avoided the lunch rush, as the line started to extend outside the door only a few minutes after I placed my order. I opted for the lunch special, in which you can choose your chosen flavor of the chicken, two sides and the type of chicken pieces you want. I chose the option for two drumsticks and two wings of the Crispy Fried Chicken, which had a garlic soy glaze, and fries and coleslaw as my sides.† I'm always skeptical of the quality of I.V. food, but this chicken did not disappoint. The skin was perfectly crispy and crunchy and the meat was well seasoned and moist. The garlic flavor from the glaze also gave the chicken a unique flavor that is lacking from ordinary American fried chicken. Although the portion was small, the coleslaw was tasty and helped balance out all the savoriness of the chicken. The only gripe I had with my meal was that the fries were not seasoned at all and did not come with dipping sauce, so I would go for another side next time. As for the portion sizes, the four pieces of chicken were perfect and I left the restaurant feeling pretty full. I'd definitely come back to try the other types of fried chicken and the other menu items. If you like a good deal, I would recommend visiting the restaurant when they have their lunch special since it's around $10, and you can easily run up a high bill if you go during regular hours when the special isn't offered.

on-the-menu,Hooked on Hook & Press,9-Dec-19,5:52 PM,['Alexandra Leal Silva'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-09/hooked-on-hook-press/,"Tucked away on State Street is a little shopù known as Mosaic Locale. Inside the center are three different artisans packed behind one counter: Draughtsmen Aleworks, a brewery specializing in small batch beers; Buena Onda, an Argentinian empanada spot; and finally the illustrious Hook & Press. Hook & Press is a donut shop unlike any other in the area. They specialize in Instagram-worthy donuts and the pictures online were nothing compared to the real thing.† Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus The Hook & Press website tells the story of how John Burnett went from a former banker to a passionate baker and conceived the idea for Hook & Press back in 2014. Burnett officially opened Hook & Press in October 2018 and since then, it has cultivated a strong fan base in SB, being known as the only shop that specializes in artisan donuts.† From the moment you walk in, the display case invites you to take in all the flavors and designs. The woman behind the counter informed me that H&P changes their flavors every season and while a few are constant tenants, the rest rotate through. Behind her, there was a large chalkboard displaying their prices for a single donut ($3.50), a dozen donuts and the variety of coffees they sell. The display case held about six different flavors, with choices ranging from Horchata Crumb, P.O.G (Passionfruit, Orange, Guava), Pumpkin Spice Latte and a range of donut holes. My partner and I decided upon the Coastal Fog for him and the Snickers for myself.† Outside the small venue is a quiet patio where one can relax and enjoy their food while watching people strut down State Street. We chose a table and took a moment before biting into our donuts. They were wider than our hands and generously covered in their respective toppings.† Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus Upon the first bite, it felt like I was in a chocolatey fever dream. The donut itself was fluffy and felt light but was covered in a decadent frosting with lines of caramel and other chocolate sauces. As someone who had a deep chocolate craving that day, it satisfied me to my soul. The caramel was a bit sticky to hold but it was a small price to pay for indulgence.† My partner, Sean, chose the Coastal Fog and was not disappointed. He remarked at how the flavor stayed steady but was never overpowering. He was kind enough to share with me and I liked how soft the flavor sat on my palate as opposed to the strong chocolatey flavors of the other. Sean spent much of his childhood in England and was able to confirm that it tasted like an authentic London Fog with an SB twist. Overall, while it may not be the best choice to slide through every day, health-wise or budget-wise, these donuts are the perfect way to satisfy your cravings and indulge in pastry goodness. If you have friends or family visiting SB, I highly recommend this spot to make them wish they could come back sooner!

He had a soft opening on Nov. 13 and has been working ever since. He runs everything himself, but his roommate Chance Hope has been incredibly helpful in promoting his new service!† He started this business as a way to provide healthy, affordable meals to as many people as possible. Food security and a lack of nutrition is a major issue for many college students. By offering fresh food for as little as $3, his ultimate goal is to be able to expand and serve the community at large in order to make sure everyone is able to get a sustainable amount of food.† For the soft opening, he is currently just selling a couple of different types of stir fry. He chose to offer stir fry to start with because it provides a perfect combination of rice, vegetables and chicken.† Clarke says that he highly recommends the sweet chili flavor, as it offers a nice balance of flavors. It looks fairly simple, but with the amount of prep for the chicken, carrots and vegetables, it actually becomes pretty time-consuming, adding up to about 15-30 minutes a batch. Thankfully, he can make about four to six portions at one time. When speaking of the future goal for his business, Clarke says, I plan on expanding the menu over time as I am getting more customers and am able to add people to my team. Fried chicken will probably be the first thing I add to the menu, and I've discussed offering service for brunch and making things like French toast and eggs.ù† Want to know how much this all costs?: Portion sizes are $3 for a small, $5 for medium, $7 for large and $10 for extra-large. To order, people can contact him either on Facebook Messenger or message fam-deliveries on Snapchat. Also, a big plus he is currently running delivery from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on weekdays so order order order and enjoy a nice warm plate of food.

on-the-menu,Holiday Treats in Disneyland,23-Dec-19,12:07 AM,['Aiko Delos Reyes'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-23/holiday-treats-in-disneyland/,"In order to relieve myself of the inescapable end-of-the-quarter stress, I did what any responsible college student would: I spent the day at Disneyland as an act of self care. My main goals for the day were to first ride Haunted Mansion and see the Nightmare Before Christmas-themed decorations and secondly, try the holiday foods that have been endlessly taunting me on my Instagram feed. Aiko Delos Reyes / Daily Nexus My first seasonal treat of the day was the Burnt Ends Grilled Cheese at the River Belle Terrace. Although this sandwich was on the pricier side for amusement park food, it was worth it. The sandwich was packed with Kansas City-style burnt brisket ends, tossed in Coca Cola barbecue sauce that cut through all the melted cheese, all topped with fried onions and pickled pepperoncini. Apparently, the relish tastes exactly like that of the famous Disneyland pickles. If you're a fan of that taste, this is definitely something worth trying. I ordered it with the River Belle Terrace's signature baked beans and a side of tater tots. The tater tots were an especially pleasant surprise î they're fried to perfection and coated in a barbecue seasoning. Overall, this is the perfect meal to chow down on after a morning of exploring the park. Aiko Delos Reyes / Daily Nexus For a mid-afternoon snack, I decided to try out the Hot Chocolate Beignets served at Caf√© Orleans. The beignets are dusted with a light coating of chocolate powder and served with a velvety chocolate dipping sauce, as well as a heaping serving of marshmallow whipped cream. I was a little hesitant with ordering this one since all the photos online made the dessert look sickeningly sweet. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the chocolate powder taste was subtle and the dipping sauce had a rich cacao flavor rather than the syrupy taste I expected. In the end, I used every last drop of the dipping sauce because it was that good. This was definitely my favorite holiday treat. Towards the end of my day, I headed over to California Adventures and got Luigi's Chicken Pesto Cone from Cozy Cone Motel. The cone is comprised of creamy pesto alfredo pasta, marinated chicken, balsamic reduction, tomato bruschetta and romano cheese. I don't usually tend to eat the regular bread cones since they're pretty heavy, but I'm a sucker for tomato bruschetta and I had to give this seasonal offering a try. The tomatoes and pasta paired nicely together, and the flavors were well balanced. The bread cones are pretty big and they give you a decent serving of pasta. At $9, I'd say that this meal is a bang for your buck.† Aiko Delos Reyes / Daily Nexus Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try everything I wanted to since the park was so packed. But I'll definitely be back before the end of the holiday season to try more of Disneyland's seasonal items!

This list is curated to showcase all of my favorite (and diverse) food gems in the city. These places will make sure you have the tastiest NYC food adventures! Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus PIZZA 1. Wheated (Ditmas Park, Brooklyn) This is my favorite hidden pizza gem and it happens to be my neighborhood pizza joint. In the heart of Brooklyn, this is the best place to get cozy and have one of the most delicious pies. I definitely recommend trying their homemade spicy honey because I swear by it now. I love ending my meal with their chocolate cake because they warm it up in the pizza oven to make it ooze.† 2. L'industrie Pizza (Williamsburg, Brooklyn) This is a Williamsburg pizza gem. It is a small shop with some window seating, but it has the most fresh and delicious slices of pizza. They have some fun ones, like their white pizza with creme fraiche, mozzarella, goat cheese, bacon and honey. For something simpler like margherita, you can dress it up with some ham or mushrooms. A perfect spot to grab a pie and have a picnic by the water with a good view of Manhattan.† 3. Joe's Pizza (Several Manhattan and Brooklyn locations)† Joe's is one of THE classic NYC slices. It's the greasy, delicious slice that other cities try to recreate but will never get quite right. I love coming to the Union Square location after walking around downtown or seeing a movie for a fun late-night dinner with my friends. It's worth getting two, trust me.† 4. Prince Street Pizza (SoHo, Manhattan) The home of another classic NYC pie, this spot is known for the square pepperoni slice. Located smack in the middle of SoHo, don't be surprised if there is a line out the door because it is there for a reason. Those waiting in line are about to have a slice of pizza with a crunchy yet soft crust and gooey cheese, perfectly thick with just the right amount of spice pepperoni. Find a nice bench outside and enjoy!† † BAGELS 1. Russ & Daughters (Lower East Side, Manhattan) This is my go-to place for a classic New York bagel with lox! There is a wide range of lox, cream cheese and even meat to choose from so you can try all the New York combos. It is the best place to experience a more traditional version of a New York deli.† † ISRAELI† 1. Miznon (Chelsea, Manhattan)† This is the most delicious place for lunch in the iconic Chelsea Market. Originally opened by famous chef Eyal Shani, it is the best place to try Mediterrean street food inspired by fresh seasonal ingredients. The pitas are unmatched. The sweet potato and baby cauliflower are mouthwatering. The music and energy of the place will definitely make you want to dance! Breads is home to the famous chocolate babka. There are plenty of other delicious treats like pound cake, rugelach, a perfect apple strudel and hamantaschen cookies! However, the babka is by far a singularly iconic dessert with its perfect crunch and melting chocolate. Walk over to Union Square to sit on the steps by the subway and enjoy the goodies from the bakery if you choose to take them out.††††††† † ITALIAN 1. Lella Alimentari (Williamsburg, Brooklyn) A North Side Williamsburg gem. Run by an Italian couple, this is a real Italian cafe, which also sells staple Italian ingredients. The sandwiches are made with homemade bread and are to die for. The classic, which comes with crudo di parma, arugula and stracchino cheese, and the two cheese, which comes with with gorgonzola, stracchino and radicchio, are just two of their most tasty options. There is one with Nutella, which tastes even better with their coffee. It's the perfect taste of Italy in Williamsburg! 2. Nicandra's (Bushwick, Brooklyn)† This is a special place for my family because the owner is so kind and the food is absolutely stunning. They have the best homemade pastas with a rotating menu based on seasonal ingredients and the pasta portions are always enough to fill you up. The glazed pork ribs, burrata, duck ragu pappardelle and squid ink sagnarelli are my favorites. This is also an awesome stop for a brunch in Brooklyn.† 3. Spaghetti Incident (Lower East Side, Manhattan)† They are famous for their spaghetti in a cone to go which was inspired by street food in 1950s Italy. However, the cozy ò70s inspired interior is just as fun to enjoy as their pasta on the go. There are special menu items that rotate daily, amazing arancinis and many mouthwatering pasta dishes.† † JAPANESE 1. Nonono (Midtown, Manhattan)† Right in Midtown, Nonono is great for lunch or dinner. This is my favorite spot for yakitori. It is super fun to go with a few friends for dinner and order all the different kinds of yakitori because they are affordable, absolutely delicious, come quick and are good to share. For lunch they offer rice bowls that come with yakitori, soup and salad, as well as several ramen noodle dishes. Also, try one of their Japanese-inspired desserts like the black sesame panna cotta, yuzu sorbet and raindrop pudding.† 2. Ippudo (East Village, Manhattan)† Always with a line out the door, this is the top ramen spot. It originally started in Japan but now has a few locations opened in NYC. The chefs always greet you as you walk to your table and the restaurant is always buzzing with high energy. I recommend starting with some pork buns and adding egg to whichever ramen you choose. The food is amazing and it's a super fun experience.† 3. Ootoya (Midtown, Manhattan) This is another gem that originally started in Japan and now has a few places open in NYC. It is great for both lunch and dinner. They offer a wide range of food from sushi to soba to vegetables wrapped in pork belly. They have a lot of traditional Japanese dishes and the portions are sized perfectly to make you full but still able to try a variety of foods. 4. Cocoron (Lower East Side, Manhattan)† If you aren't completely sold on ramen, soba is the way to go. I actually prefer soba myself and this is my favorite spot. They have hot and cold soba, which are both interesting to try. Their green tea affogato dessert with some soba tea is definitely the way to finish the meal. I used to come here for lunch with my dad every weekend and I can safely say it never gets old.† † DIM SUM 1. Tim Ho Wan (East Village, Manhattan) This is my favorite dim sum spot in the east village. The BBQ pork buns and steamed rice rolls are too good to not to get two portions. Luckily you can mark off more and more food on the paper as you wish. Dim sum is a fun meal and there is no better way to try tons of new food.† † CARRIBEAN† 1. The Food Sermon (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) For some amazing Caribbean-inspired flavors in one delicious bowl, this is the spot to go. With options including spicy jerk chicken, pan-seared tofu, oxtail and even coconut-ginger lamb shank, a meal here will be the most flavorful and filling. It is worth the trip to Crown Heights in Brooklyn to visit this cute corner restaurant.†† † TACOS 1. Los Tacos No. 1 (Chelsea, Manhattan & other new Manhattan locations) This is THE taco spot of Chelsea Market. There is always a line here, but they have a few other locations now so getting tasty tacos is a little faster. It was created by three close friends to bring authentic Mexican tacos to the East Coast. With the simplest and most delicious ingredients, this is a fun and tasty stop. If you've never had a grilled cactus taco or quesadilla, you definitely need to try them here.† † BURGERS 1. Juanchi's Burger (Williamsburg, Brooklyn) Here is the hub for ordering a delicious burger in Williamsburg with a Venzuelan twist. The place has an artsy vibe with paintings on the walls and newspaper-lined trays. With locally sourced ingredients, the burgers are mind-blowingly good, filling and creative. Just imagine a burger with white cheese, grilled plantain and a honey ginger tarragon sauce ¶ yum.† 2. Shake Shack (Many locations)† This is the In-N-Out of the East Coast and it is my best fast food recommendation. A classic Shack burger with fries and a shake but East Coast style î the experience will do all the explaining because this stop is a must.†† 
BRUNCH 1. Clinton St. Baking Company & Restaurant (Lower East Side, Manhattan & Time Out Market, Dumbo)† Here is the spot for getting the most famous pancakes in NYC. I would recommend coming here for brunch and although all of the food is amazing, the classic pancakes are my favorite. The wild maine blueberry pancakes with the warm maple butter on the side are especially good. If the brunch line is too long, pop into the Time Out Market in Dumbo to grab some late-night pancakes for dessert.† † COFFEE 1. Seven Grams Caffe (Several Manhattan locations) If you happen to be in Manhattan in the Flatiron, Chelsea or Hudson Square areas, this is your best coffee stop. They follow the traditional Italian process, taking seven grams of the best quality and freshly ground coffee beans to brew their coffee. It's delicious and goes well with all their in-house baked pastries. Even the aesthetic of the coffee shop is stunning.† 2. Sey Coffee (Bushwick, Brooklyn) If you're in the hipster Williamsburg and Bushwick area, then this is the hidden coffee shop to go to. It has a super cool vibe with a lot of natural light and plants filling the space. They have really high quality coffee and complex flavors.† 3. Coffee Project (Fort Greene, Brooklyn or East Village) The Brooklyn location is where I have some of my funniest memories with my best friends as we would sit there for hours after school. They are an amazing coffee shop with high quality beans and machines. They actually offer a range of classes like brewing, cupping, and barista basics which could be a cool experience for a coffee lover.† 4. Everyman Espresso (Park Slope, Brooklyn or SoHo/East Village) This specialty coffee shop gives more of a homey feeling, with three locations in NYC. Everyone is always really friendly and the coffee is excellent. A great stop if you're in Park Slope, SoHo or the East Village.† 5. Happy Bones (SoHo, Manhattan) Happy Bones is a trendy coffee shop owned by New Zealanders that displays cool local art and publications. The coffee paired with a delicious pastry will never disappoint here.† † DESSERT 1. Sundaes and Cones (East Village, Manhattan) This happens to be the best homemade ice cream in the East Village. The ice cream is of the highest quality, but the range of flavors is even better. You can choose to go with the classic chocolate or vanilla, but you can also be adventurous and try taro, wasabi, black sesame, thai tea, black raspberry or tiramisu. 2. Kee's Chocolate (Midtown West, Manhattan) If you want some crazy good chocolates, this is my secret spot. The flavors are so distinct and the combinations are wildly delicious. Passion fruit, raspberry, thai chili, blood orange, lemongrass mint, earl grey or black sesame with dark chocolate ganache are only a few of the heavenly flavors they offer. They also have truffles with almond, coconut, cognac or pignoli, to name a few.† 3. Fabrique (Chelsea, Manhattan) This is a famous chain from Sweden that opened up in Chelsea, which has met all of my Scandinavian bakery needs. The cinnamon and cardamom bun are my favorites, but the chokladbollar (chocolate balls) and raspberry cakes are top notch too. This is a great coffee and pastry stop after gallery hopping or walking the High Line. The cafe itself is super cute too.†† 4. Win Son Bakery (East Williamsburg, Manhattan) This is a great Brooklyn Taiwanese-American bakery with coffee, pastries, sandwiches and small bites. With red rice donuts, custard toast, black sugar egg tarts, milk bun BEC (bacon, egg and cheese) sandwiches and pork rice rolls, this bakery has the coolest food options for any mood and its uniqueness makes it very New York.† 5. The Blue Stove (Williamsburg, Brooklyn) We can all admit that pie is one of the best, if not the best, desserts. This is the best pie place and they have seasonal fruit, custard and cream pie options. A few of the fall flavors are raspberry plum with pecan crumble, pear cranberry dark chocolate, maple bourbon walnut and bittersweet chocolate mousse. There are plenty more and you can never get bored because of the rotating seasonal flavors.† 6. Harbs (Chelsea, Soho, Upper East Side, Manhattan) Harbs is an authentic Japanese cafe which brought its delicious cakes to NYC. My personal favorite is the mille crepes cake, which is a six layer crepe cake filled with fresh fruits and mixed cream. Green tea mousse, baked cheesecake topped with blueberry jam, lemon yogurt and pear mille-feuille cake would go well with one of their teas after an evening out. 7. Doughnut Project (West Village, Manhattan) This shop was opened by a bartender and lawyer and features the most stunning donuts. These donuts are made with love and feature seriously cool flavors. Some mouthwatering options include the úeverythingù doughnut with sweet cream cheese glaze topped with the seeds from a typical everything bagel, the Tullamore donut made with Irish whiskey and espresso topped with cocoa, and the úthose beetz,ù which has a beet glaze filled with ricotta whip.† 8. Alimama Tea (Chinatown, Manhattan) If the Doughnut Project doesn't have funky enough donuts or you love donuts so much you want more, then this is the spot. This place is famous for their mochi donuts and they definitely hit the spot. Also, they happen to be gluten free! Brulee, cereal, matcha or sweet and savory are some of the awesome donut flavors, but I suggest getting a cream puff too because it gives you the full experience.† 9. Joey Bats Caf√© (Lower East Side, Manhattan) After I came back from Portugal, I thought I would never find past√©is de nata that measured up. I stumbled upon this cafe and I've never been so happy to say I found the perfect spot. They have the authentic custard tart with cinnamon tastes like a warm creme brulee wrapped in a flakey croissant. If you're in the lower east side, you have to check it out.† 10. Burrow (Dumbo, Brooklyn) Some of the places I mentioned are secret local gems, but this one happens to be actually located in a secret-looking location. In the heart of Dumbo, you walk into a nothing-looking building until you reach another door that leads into this small bakery. This magical place is only open on weekdays, but it's worth going to try the cream puffs, almond tuile and one of the daily changing cakes.†† Having grown up in NYC, I've spent a lot of time eating at the hyped new places, the restaurants in less touristy areas and discovering places that are usually hard to find in such a large city. I hope that if you visit these places you feel more like a local and enjoy all the city has to offer! 
Print You say you have eaten in the less hyped areas but not one recommendation in Queens, Harlem or the Bronx. No idea what real NYC is

on-the-menu,New Year's Resolution: Take a Healthy Initiative in 2020,9-Jan-20,12:37 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/new-years-resolution-take-a-healthy-initiative-in-2020/,"The new year often comes with new goals for self-improvement. For many people, this means enlisting new practices to improve their health. While fad diets and strict workout plans may catch your attention, simple health practices are more important to sustain a healthy lifestyle. Here are eight tips you can follow to start your 2020 in a healthy direction. Photo courtesy of Publicdomainphotos.net It's a known fact that drinking water throughout the day can help improve energy levels and aid in digestion. However, many students and young adults still don't drink enough water to keep themselves going throughout the day. While the eight cups a dayù rule is reasonable to shoot for, according to Mayoclinic.org, it's even more important to listen to your body and take in as much water as you need. This will most likely be more than just eight cups if you are active throughout the day. Perhaps the simplest tip to keep in mind when putting together nutritious meals is to incorporate more vegetables. Adding something green to each meal is a great way to pack in nutrition and keep you feeling full. Although working toward a healthier lifestyle this year may mean watching what you eat more closely, moderation is key. We all have moments where we crave unhealthy options, and that's completely okay. One of my favorite ways to look at moderation is from the 80/20 perspective. If you're eating clean 80% of the time and you eat unhealthy foods 20% of the time, it shouldn't hinder your health. This mindset is great for making healthy living sustainable for the long run. If you ever find yourself losing energy as the day drags on even when you are eating right and exercising, you may be deficient in some sort of vitamin. For example, because I eat a plant-based diet, I tend to be deficient in iron and vitamin B. I found that the easiest way to eliminate this deficiency and maintain other vitamin levels was to start taking a multivitamin every morning. Not only can this be a preventative measure, but it's also a great way to further nourish your body. Sometimes the most difficult part about cooking and choosing foods for yourself can be knowing the proper portion sizes. It's important for us to eat enough for our bodies to be fueled and ready to perform. However, it's also important not to overwhelm our bodies by consuming too much, which has adverse effects on our health. A great way to learn about proper portioning is to eat slowly and listen to your body to determine when it is satisfied. Although this one goes without saying, many busy adults frequently skip meals due to having little time or forgetting entirely. Not only does going without food slow down our metabolism, it also can decrease our blood sugar, making it more difficult to think straight. This negative habit detrimentally affects our health and stands in the way of our productivity. There are many ways to counteract this, such as carrying snacks to eat throughout the day or meal prepping for the week. We should always make time for our health first. In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle this year, it's important to consume a balance of all the major food groups. The negative stigma around carbs and fats can sometimes alter our perceptions about health. Although an abundance of unhealthy carbs like pizza or pasta may not be the best option, our bodies do need complex carbohydrates. The goal should be to eat a balanced meal with some combination of vegetables, healthy fats, proteins and carbohydrates. This is perhaps the most important tip because it applies to every other tip. Knowing what your body needs and treating it well is the best way to start living healthier this year. Finding healthy food combinations that you actually enjoy not only makes healthy living easier but also sustainable. If going to the gym isn't something you find enjoyment in, look into other exercise methods that could spark your interest. Health looks different for every person and it's your job to discover what health means to you this year.

on-the-menu,Start the Day Right: The Power of the Adrenal Cocktail,9-Jan-20,12:44 AM,['Kayla Kressin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/start-the-day-right-the-power-of-the-adrenal-cocktail/,"What if I told you there is a cocktail that could make you feel better? This cocktail provides energy while helping to offset stress and even infections. And it's also something you can easily and cheaply make yourself. Photo courtesy of Flickr.com Do I have your attention? Well, before describing how to make it, it's important to understand your body and a bit of biochemistry. The adrenal gland is located just above the kidneys and is vital for regulating different hormone levels including cortisol, aldosterone and, of course, adrenaline. These hormones control the body's energy levels, including the ability to increase your blood pressure or heart rate to respond to stressful situations. An imbalance in any of your adrenal gland hormone levels can cause everything to fall out of place, possibly making you tired or simply not feeling your best. For instance, a blood pressure drop due to lack of the aldosterone hormone can even result in brain fog, inhibiting concentration on academic studies and simple day-to-day tasks. So, it is really important to manage these hormone levels. The path to balanced hormone levels starts with balanced minerals in your body. Sodium and potassium are the two most important elements for maintaining the hormone aldosterone. In each of our cells, there is a sodium-potassium ion pump. This active transport process is responsible for maintaining equilibrium inside the cell, importing potassium and exporting sodium. The ideal intracellular sodium-to-potassium ratio is 1:16. But the problem is that the average American diet consists of more sodium than potassium. The human body needs 3,500 milligrams to 4,700 milligrams of potassium every day. However, according to a study by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the average American only consumes about half of that. Without the proper amount of potassium, the sodium-potassium ion pumps of each cell cannot function properly. To maintain the 1:16 ratio, the cell pumps additional sodium out of the cell, taking water with it because sodium ions must chemically bond to water molecules to be transported.
This overcompensation process leaves the cell dehydrated, sodium deficient and decreases the adrenal function. Due to electrolyte depletion, not enough aldosterone is produced, resulting in fatigue. Some try to fix the fatigue with caffeine or sugars or even a nap, but in actuality, the proper fix is simply to improve your mineral balance. Typically, between the hours of 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and/or between 2 p.m to 3 p.m., our bodies naturally start to run out of the adrenal gland's hormones, and more is needed. However, if our body has no ingredients, in this case minerals, to make more energizing hormones, we instead start to wind down. By consuming an adrenal cocktailù at these times, the adrenal gland will receive the right amount of sodium and potassium to release hormones of the adrenal gland, like aldosterone, to get those cells pumping. Adrenal Cocktail Recipe:
4 ounces Orange Juice 1/4 teaspoon Celtic Sea Salt 1/4 teaspoon Cream of Tartar The orange juice contains vitamin C, which can help heal damage caused by stress on the body. This type of stress includes physical stress, such as that caused by an injury. Organic orange juice contains more vitamin C than its non-organic counterpart because it is less processed.
Celtic Sea Salt is recommended over table salt because it does not contain extra additives, such as iodine in table salt. Also, sea salt contains trace minerals which add to our needed electrolyte values. Cream of Tartar is the common name for potassium bitartrate. It is a white powdery substance that is soluble in water and acid, meaning it's perfect for dissolving in the citrus juice. When making the cocktail, it's important to mix and shake it thoroughly so the potassium doesn't just drift to the bottom of the cup.
Not long after drinking this cocktail, you will feel rejuvenated as you will have fixed your fatigue the right way! Also, you can spend your money on something other than coffee, kombucha and yerba mate. Start your new year right by drinking an adrenal cocktail twice a day. Of course, not any cocktail, but the amazing adrenal cocktail!

on-the-menu,Cafe Bora: Home of Purple Potato Desserts,10-Jan-20,12:31 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-10/cafe-bora-home-of-purple-potato-desserts/,"Cafe Bora, a Korean dessert spot that prides itself on its beautiful confections using 100% natural ingredients, is the perfect quick bite if you find yourself craving something sweet in Los Angeles. The cafe's roots come from the purple sweet potato, as they specialize in shaved ice and ice cream made from this potato. The first U.S. branch of this popular Korean dessert chain opened up in Koreatown in 2017 and has been serving chic, decadent treats ever since. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I had been wanting to visit the cafe for a while and when I finally made the trip down to Los Angeles, Cafe Bora's desserts exceeded my expectations. The ambiance of the cafe was very chic and minimalistic. The menu displayed photos of all the items, and seeing all the desserts made me want to try everything. Despite my irrational craving to get every item on the menu, I settled on the persimmon bingsu, the purple potato ice cream and the purple potato tiramisu. The persimmon bingsu is a shaved ice dessert with persimmon syrup drizzled on top. Unlike other shaved ice syrups, the persimmon syrup tasted extremely fresh and did not taste like any artificial flavoring was used. It was almost as if I just took a bite out of an actual persimmon. Although at first I was scared I would run out of syrup, the dish came with additional syrup in a cute bowl adorned with some purple potato chips and walnuts to prevent that from happening. This bingsu was extremely tasty and its flavor was not at all overbearing. The purple potato ice cream was just a standard soft serve with purple potato flavoring. It was delicious but nothing too special, although it complemented the chips nicely. I would try this item if you're looking for something simple yet filling.† The tiramisu, however, was phenomenal. The different layers in the dessert mingled with each other perfectly. The soft sponge cake, purple potato cream and purple potato paste made each bite exceptional and I couldn't get enough. It wasn't overly sweet and I enjoyed it so much that I'd say that it's worth driving through LA traffic just to try this tiramisu. Overall, Cafe Bora gave me everything I wanted and more. Everything on the menu looked delicious and they even swap out their desserts to fit the freshest ingredients of the season, but don't worry because their purple potato desserts are offered year round. To make the most out of your visit, I would go with a group of friends so that you can try the most amount of desserts without getting too full.

on-the-menu,"New Year, New Drinks: Starbucks' Dairy-Free Beverages",16-Jan-20,12:14 AM,['Michelle Wan'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/new-year-new-starbucks-drinks/,"With the new decade just kicking off, Starbucks has already added two new drinks to their menu: the Coconutmilk Latte and the Almondmilk Honey Flat White. These plant-based milk alternative drinks were added as part of their new winter food and beverage lineup.ù Each option gives vegans and lactose-intolerants more options to choose from. Since the weather is starting to turn chilly, I decided to try out these hot new drinks to see how good they taste! Photo courtesy of Needpix.com Coconutmilk Latte Compared to a regular latte, the Coconutmilk Latte contains a subtle, yet distinct coconut taste, giving it a unique flavor. In my opinion, Starbucks' regular latte has a smoother taste while the Coconutmilk Latte has a sharper taste due to the sweeter milk alternative. In an article titled, Starbucks introduces first new beverages of 2020ù from Starbucks Stories & News, product developer Raegan Powell explains that cascara sugar was added to the top of the drink to add a bit of sweetness without overpowering the beverage.ù The drink was, indeed, less bitter than a regular latte, but the overall taste still had a slight bitterness. Despite this, the drink was enjoyable. 
 Tip: Plan on ordering the beverage hot because the ice will water down the taste a lot.† Almondmilk Honey Flat White While the Coconutmilk Latte was on the bitter side of the spectrum, the Almondmilk Honey Flat White was on the sweeter side. The honey was the attention-catcher while the almond milk taste was subtle. However, the slight nutty flavor perfectly complemented the honey. While the beverage is sweeter than the Coconutmilk Latte, I felt it was the perfect sweetness as it did not overpower the beverage.† My personal favorite of Starbucks' new dairy-free menu additions was the Almondmilk Honey Flat White, since I enjoy sweet drinks more than bitter ones. I believe that both drinks will be a big hit, especially since they are made with milk alternatives that many people enjoy. Stop by your nearest Starbucks to try these drinks out, and maybe one of them will be your next favorite drink!

Eggs Benedict may seem intimidating, but the dish is actually much more simple than it looks and requires minimal cooking.

on-the-menu,Lucky Lunar New Year Foods,23-Jan-20,8:03 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/lucky-lunar-new-year-foods/,"The Lunar New Year celebrates the coming year according to the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar in Asian countries such as China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea î and it's just around the corner! A huge aspect of the Lunar New Year celebration is the food because it is said that eating certain foods during the celebration will bring in luck, prosperity and health for the new year. Check out this list of what these different Asian countries eat to ring in the new year! Photo Courtesy of Flickr.com CHINA Dumplings Dumplings are eaten on Lunar New Year's Eve and are believed to bring wealth into the new year. This belief is based on the fact that Chinese dumplings are shaped like ingots, which was the currency used in imperial China. Like the ingots, Chinese dumplings are boat-shaped, oval and turned up at the two ends. The dumplings have a variety of fillings, but they usually contain some variation of pork, shrimp, beef and vegetables. They can be steamed or pan-fried. Nian Gao (Glutinous Rice Cake) Nian Gao is a glutinous rice cake that is steamed or fried. The name of the dessert itself, Nian Gao, sounds like it means the year getting higher and higher,ù which is why eating this dish during Lunar New Year festivities is said to bring a higher income or job position in the upcoming year.† Spring Rolls Spring rolls are made with a meat and vegetable filling wrapped in a thin dough, and then fried. They are golden-yellow in color, which makes them resemble gold bars and symbolize prosperity for the new year. Tang Yuan (Glutinous Rice Balls) These glutinous rice balls are desserts filled with sweets like red bean paste or black sesame paste. They are usually served in a simple sweet syrup and vary in size. The pronunciation and round shape of Tang Yuan are associated with reunion and being together.† † JAPAN Ozoni (Mochi Soup) Traditional foods known as osechi ryoriù are eaten to celebrate the new year in Japanese culture. Osechi ryori consists of a variety of dishes served in a fancy, multi-layered bento and is served with a traditional soup called ozoni. The dish has its roots in samurai-society cuisine, where it was offered to the gods in a ceremony on Lunar New Year's Eve. There are many variations of ozoni depending on the region of Japan where the soup is made, but all versions of the soup are eaten with a piece of grilled or boiled mochi. Common additions to the soup include chicken, fish, meatballs, leafy vegetables and flakes of yuzu peel for its citrus fragrance. The type of broth can also vary, as some soups are made with a miso-based broth and others are made with a clear, dashi-based broth. Kuri Kinton (Candied Chestnuts and Sweet Potatoes) This dish is made by mashing the syrup of candied chestnuts with gold sweet potatoes. It is considered a type of comfort food because of its sweetness and is only served during the Lunar New Year. The yellow color of the treat symbolizes economic fortune and wealth in the new year Kazunoko (Herring Roe) Herring roe is a delicacy served during Lunar New Year celebrations to wish for the prosperity of the children or grandchildren in one's family, because the tiny fish eggs represent fertility. The caviar is steeped in a light dashi broth and lightly seasoned with soy sauce.† † VIETNAM Banh Chung (Square Steamed Cake) This is the most typical food eaten to celebrate Tet, the Vietnamese New Year. The square-shaped rice cake is made of glutinous sticky rice, pork and mung bean wrapped in banana leaves. The shape represents the earth and is eaten to show respect for ancestors and nature. Banh Tet (Cylindrical Steamed Cake) Banh Tet is similar to Banh Chung in that they both use the same ingredients and cooking methods, but they differ in shape. Banh Tet is cylindrical, which represents the moon. This steamed cake is more popular in southern Vietnam, and all members of the family are involved in the process of making Banh Tet because it allows them to bond and celebrate the holiday spirit together. Boiled Chicken† A whole boiled chicken is a staple dish in any Vietnamese celebration, especially during the new year. The chicken symbolizes abundance, prosperity and well-being and is often presented on the ancestor worship altar along with fruits, flowers, candles and incense sticks. † KOREA Tteokguk (Rice Cake Soup) Tteokguk is a traditional Korean dish eaten during the celebration of the Korean New Year that is made of a meat and soy sauce-based stock (tuk) with thinly sliced rice cakes (tteok). This dish is eaten during the Lunar New Year celebration to signify growing a year older and is believed to bring good luck, good health and a long life. Another dish, called manduguk, is similar to tteokguk, but includes dumplings. Galbi Jjim (Beef Short Ribs) Galbi Jjim is a popular Korean dish made with beef short ribs braised in a sweet and salty sauce with carrots and potatoes. Because of the lengthy preparation of the dish and the price of galbi in Korea, this dish is reserved for special occasions such as Korean New Year.

on-the-menu,The Buzz About Caffeine: Is it Helpful or Harmful?,26-Jan-20,5:20 PM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/the-buzz-about-caffeine-is-it-helpful-or-harmful/,"If you have suffered through early eight a.m. classes or last-minute late-night studying, you know what it's like to be a sleep-deprived UC Santa Barbara student. The most common cure to this daily exhaustion is caffeine. Throughout campus, you can see students running to Starbucks for a cold brew or the Arbor for a yerba mate. Regardless of their preference, students are constantly relying on caffeine to stay energized throughout the school day. However, that daily caffeine fix has many different effects on the body, and it's important to know both the benefits and risks of caffeine consumption. Photo courtesy of Needpix.com The most obvious benefit of caffeine is increased alertness, which can come in handy during long school or work days. In fact, some studies indicate that drinking caffeine can enhance people's learning ability. This is due to the effect caffeine has on the brain's ability to memorize and think critically. For students working hard to cram information from their classes and complete assigned tasks, this can be highly beneficial. This is why many students become reliant on drinking caffeine every morning or multiple times a day. Athletes also are known to benefit from drinking coffee or caffeinated drinks during the day. Those who participate in sports may choose to drink caffeine right before a game, match or performance because of the sustained energy it provides. The European Food Safety Agency explains that caffeine can improve endurance and prevent early exhaustion.† Caffeine can also serve aesthetic purposes such as weight loss. Caffeine is an appetite suppressant, which can make people eat less than they would without it. It also can increase the amount of calories we burn at a resting state because it boosts your metabolism. In addition, caffeine stimulates thermogenesis so the body generates more heat when digesting food.† However, beyond these enticing benefits, caffeine comes with a few risks that should be acknowledged. The biggest risks of daily caffeine consumption comes from the excessive use of it. The recommended amount to reap its benefits is around 200 mg, and the maximum one should consume a day is 400 mg, typically two to three cups of coffee. When exceeded, caffeine can enhance depressed or anxious thoughts.† Caffeine also can influence physiological feelings. Many people who drink excessive amounts of caffeine may suffer from insomnia or have trouble falling asleep. This causes them to be in a constant cycle of lacking adequate sleep and relying on caffeine as their energy source. Beyond sleeping issues, drinking large amounts of caffeine can cause irritability, stomach aches, heartburn, dehydration, dizziness and jitters.† Like any drug, caffeine can also have addictive qualities. Many people become reliant on caffeine as their energy source. This causes them to build up a tolerance and eventually can lead to higher amounts of caffeine being consumed to achieve the same effects. The addictive qualities of caffeine are even more accentuated when a heavy coffee drinker cuts off their consumption abruptly. These withdrawal symptoms often include intense headaches and feelings of tiredness.† However, as long as people remain aware of what they're putting into their body and the amounts in which they do, the risks of caffeine consumption should not be an issue. The health benefits of caffeine are important to acknowledge. Caffeine can be a healthy or unhealthy energy source, depending on how people use it. It all comes down to moderation and mindful consumption!

on-the-menu,Top 10 Best Brunch Spots in the Santa Barbara Area,30-Jan-20,12:47 AM,['Rinah Anatalio'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/top-10-best-brunch-spots-in-the-santa-barbara-area/,"Although the best way to start your day is breakfast, the best way to start the weekend is brunch. Santa Barbara is home to many great brunch places and I have created a list for every situation you may encounter while you're here.† The Best Place To Forget Your Actions From Last Night and Cure Your Terrible Hangover: Cajun Kitchen† What to order: anything greasy Cajun Kitchen is a chain restaurant with multiple locations in the Santa Barbara and Goleta areas. They offer a variety of breakfast and Cajun foods. Their menu is extensive, which makes it a perfect read to take your mind off of whatever you did last night. The portion sizes here are very large, which can help soak up any alcohol that's still left in your body.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The Place To Take Your Parents and Pretend the Quarter Is Going Okay: Scarlett Begonia† What to order: lemon ricotta pancakes, cinnamon roll, shrimp & grits Scarlett Begonia is on the god tier of brunch places in Santa Barbara. Everything on their menu is delicious and their ingredients are all organic and locally grown. The food here is so good that your parents will take one bite of their cinnamon roll and ignore all the bad news you told them. It doesn't matter that you failed a midterm or your housemates are fighting or you bought a Coachella ticket when your rent is due next week. All that matters is that you brought them to an amazing brunch spot.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The Place To Run Into Someone You Never Want To See Again From the Night Before: Bagel Cafe What to order: Benedict Eggle, Super Emma Bagel Cafe is in the heart of Isla Vista and many students flock here after a long night. The line typically extends to the sidewalk and is filled with people you don't want to talk to. Maybe it's someone that you met the night before but don't remember their name or someone that you've had multiple classes with but never really talked to or someone you had a crush on during your first year. Regardless of who it is, you come here and only talk with the one person you came with or you stay glued to your phone, order your bagel, wait for it to be ready and walk back home.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The Place To Take Your Aesthetic Brunch Photos for Instagram: Boathouse at Hendry's Beach What to order: Boathouse Signature Breakfast Boathouse at Hendry's Beach has great views, great food and great vibes. Its location is right on the beach, making this the best place for an Instagram shoot with your friends. You can pose with your coffee cup, mimosa flute or just a glass of water since everything looks good with the Santa Barbara sun shining on you.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The Place To Get the Best Egg Popping Boomerang From Your Benedict: The Shop Kitchen What to order: any Eggs Benedict Everybody knows that a good Eggs Benedict is the epitome of brunch. At The Shop Kitchen, you're able to customize your own Eggs Benedict. It doesn't matter if you don't eat meat, if you want fish or if you want fried chicken early in the morning, there is an Eggs Benedict dish for you! You can't go wrong with any Benedict you pick on the menu, so have fun popping that yolk for the Boomerang on your Instagram story.† The Place To Get Wasted at 11 a.m. on Bottomless Mimosas: State & Fig What to order: bottomless mimosas and State burger For my 21+ friends, you know that bottomless mimosas are the way to go. There is no better way to start your morning than a mixed drink on an empty stomach. The service here is really good at making sure your mimosa flute is never empty. I highly suggest ordering something heavy for food like the State burger or the short rib Benedict to help you take advantage of the bottomless drinks. Cheers! Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The Place To Go if You Like Dessert in the Morning: Jeannine's What to order: french toast or pancake combo Jeannine's is a bakery and restaurant with multiple locations in Santa Barbara County and they have recently expanded to Goleta. Jeannine's is the perfect place to go for your sweet tooth. They offer an assortment of pastries from their bakery but one of the best dishes Jeannine's has to offer is french toast. Jeannine's makes their french toast with the challah bread from their bakery, which is so fresh and yummy. I highly recommend this place if you love a classic french toast.† Rinah Anatalio / Daily Nexus The Place To Take That Girl You Really Like but Won't Commit To: Finch & Fork What to order: short rib sweet potato hash and fire-roasted milkshake Finch & Fork has some of the best food in Santa Barbara. This is the perfect place to take that girl you won't commit to because the food is so good that she'll forget all about your commitment issues. The menu changes seasonally so you won't have to worry about ordering the same thing when you bring a different girl next quarter.† The Place To Go With Your Vegan and Vegetarian Friends Even if You Don't Like Vegan Food: Mesa Verde What to order: green plant bowl and baklava Every friend group has a vegan or vegetarian friend that always has to compromise when eating out. Lucky for them (and you!), Mesa Verde is a vegan spot that everyone will love regardless of dietary restrictions. The aesthetics and vibes of the place are super trendy and their food is delicious.† The Place To Go To Cancel Out All the Unhealthy Things You Put in Your Body the Night Before: Backyard Bowls What to order: berry bowl with coconut milk base instead of apple juice Everybody knows that ordering an acai bowl the morning after a long night is the best way to detox your body. Backyard Bowls has the best acai in Santa Barbara, in my opinion. The staff is very accommodating with any substitutions you may have but their pre-made combinations are amazing as well.†

on-the-menu,Your Guide to Snacking for the Super Bowl,31-Jan-20,5:06 PM,['Khanh Phan'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-31/your-guide-to-snacking-for-the-super-bowl/,"The Super Bowl is just around the corner, and some of you may be celebrating by throwing big parties with food and drinks. People definitely need snacks to munch on during the game, so if you're wondering what to bring to the table, here is a list of good options: Photo Courtesy of Flickr.com Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Pieces: These are so incredibly flavorful; the salt practically punches your face, and the crunch mellows it out. Any of the flavors will satisfy, but my personal favorites are the hot buffalo wing and honey mustard & onion flavor. They are available everywhere (even at the Arbor) if you want other options besides actual wings.† Hot Chips With Tapat√≠o or Valentina: The sauces are optional but are worth a try if you haven't yet. Sabritas Turbos Flamas and Baked Hot Cheetos pairs particularly well with the hot sauces. For a healthier alternative, try Popchips' Crazy Hot with Tapat√≠o. To appease the crowd, get a bag of Munchies Snack Mix, a mix of spicy and salty SunChips, Cheetos, Doritos and pretzels.† Tortilla Chips and Dip (Specifically Guacamole and Salsa): Tortilla chips are always a hit for any occasion. Avocados are on sale right now for as low as 50 cents, so make your own guacamole if you're on a budget. Jarred salsa from any grocery store is tasty and cheap and will work whether you're in a pinch or not. If you really want to have a good time, whip up a seven-layer dip.† Charcuterie Board: For a more sophisticated take, you can arrange some cheese, crackers and perhaps a bottle of wine. Get a wooden board or a plate, and start by placing brie, cheddar, gruy√®re, camembert or your personal favorite cheese on a board. Next, place the crackers, cured meat, dried fruits or nuts around the cheese. Persimmon, which pairs well with semi-soft cheese, is in season right now. But for the cheaper option, you can opt for grapes.† Popcorn: For the broke college students who still want to entertain some party guests, you can buy microwaveable popcorn or popcorn kernels and pop them yourself. You can dress them with Tapat√≠o, Cholula, Valentina, butter, salt or Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning. PopCorners and SkinnyPop have affordable prices and a variety of flavors from kettle corn to butter, but my personal favorite is white cheddar.† †TGI Friday's Potato Skins: These are intensely flavorful and salty. They're like the rare pieces of potato chips that you savor, but these bags of chips are all of those flavorful pieces that you rarely come across. They have flavors in cheddar and bacon, bacon ranch and sour cream and onion. Any one of them will satisfy your cravings as you watch the halftime show.† Brownies: For those with a sweet tooth, bake a batch of brownies with a cheap and easy brownie mix, or buy them pre-made at a grocery store. Since it's a big celebration, you can also make slutty brownies with a pack of cookie dough and a box of Oreos. Simply press the cookie batter evenly in a baking pan, then place Oreo cookies on the cookie batter, and finally top the pan with brownie batter.† If you're too lazy to go out and try these snacks, you can just order Domino's delivery.† Pro-tip: ask for their Mix & Matchù deal, which includes your choice of medium two-topping pizzas, an eight-piece chicken (boneless or wings), specialty chicken, stuffed cheesy bread, pasta and oven-baked sandwiches for only $5.99 each.

on-the-menu,A Day of Food in Ventura,6-Feb-20,12:48 AM,['Sonya Raytburg'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/a-day-of-food-in-ventura/,"Looking for an adventure, my best friend and I decided to hop on a FlixBus and go to Ventura for the day. It's the home of many cute thrift shops, a stunning pier and delicious food! We walked about seven miles and made a food stop every other mile. There is nothing better than leaving a day trip feeling full of good food so I decided to document all of the tasty spots.† Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Before heading to Ventura, we made an extensive list of places we wanted to check out, and, of course, the famous Spencer Makenzie's Fish Company was on top. Skipping breakfast to feast there at lunch was definitely worth it! It has a really cute setup with indoor and outdoor seating. There's the option to sit inside with service, but we chose to order at the booth because the weather was too nice not to eat outside. The portions looked really large, which is always a good thing, but there were so many things we wanted to try.† We decided to split three dishes: the Parker Burger, Ahi Pocket and the World Famous Fish Taco. The Parker Burger has seared ahi tuna, shredded lettuce and marinated red onions, all on a toasted bun with a side of fries. It was delicious, especially with some of their Caribbean Blaze Sauce (a tropical cayenne vinegar blend). The tuna tasted really fresh and the burger felt a lot lighter without red meat. I actually really enjoyed the burger being simple because it allowed the focus to be on the seared tuna and sauce, which were delicious and very flavorful when combined. The Ahi Pocket was a sweet tofu pocket stuffed with sushi rice and topped with Dynamite sauce and blackened ahi tuna. I think this might have been my favorite of the three because it was so simple, and the light sweet taste of the tofu was yummy and really brought out the flavor of the tuna and sauce. When fish is fresh, the simpler the dish the better! Lastly we tried the World Famous Fish Taco, which we had with grilled fish (though tempura is another option) and was topped with chopped cabbage, cilantro, bell pepper, and the Spencer Sauce on a flour tortilla. I really enjoyed the pop of flavor from the pepper, and the grilled fish was fresh and went amazingly with the Caribbean Blaze Sauce that I mentioned earlier. Fish tacos are one of my favorite foods and Spencer Makenzie's earned my approval with this one! Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus After lunch, I always get a coffee craving. I'm a little bit of a coffee addict and I'm very specific about where I get coffee. I was set on going to one coffee shop in Ventura that happened to be the furthest away from where the main street was. We walked a mile to go to Singing Sun Coffee and I'm very glad that we did. The place was quiet, big and full of natural light. Their Instagram account actually shows the building progress of the interior, which is very impressive. The photos speak for themselves î I think this is the perfect place to sit down for your coffee break in Ventura! Not only was the aesthetic perfect, but the coffee was delicious. I usually crave a piece of gum after coffee because of the bitter espresso aftertaste, but this coffee was special because it's rare that I want to savor the taste of coffee after I'm done with my drink. There was no after-coffee gum for me at Singing Sun Coffee. Without getting too technical about beans, I know that they have top-notch single-origin beans for coffee lovers and they have fancy drinks for adventurous coffee drinkers. I went with my usual cortado but they also had options like tumeric lattes, espresso with cinnamon, honey and vanilla flavor and even wildflower tea with steamed oat milk. It's worth the mile walk from the main street, especially with the nice views of the ocean! On the mile walk back we got hungry for a pastry, so back on the main street we stopped at Caf√©† du Suro. They had stunning freshly baked bread, macaroons and sandwiches, so this definitely would be a great lunch stop. We went for a puff pastry with mascarpone, cinnamon, walnuts and honey.† Sometimes desserts can be too sweet to actually focus on the taste, but it had the perfect balance of sweetness. We relaxed outside and enjoyed the calm afternoon at their cute outdoor seating.† Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus We ended the day at Rumfish y Vino for dinner. About a block off the main street, this restaurant is very spacious with lovely outdoor seating. The vibe was great and laid back. The restaurant was completely full, which added good energy to the restaurant's atmosphere and made the dinner more enjoyable. As for food, we started with the Peruvian ceviche which had red snapper, ginger, sweet pepper, fresh squeezed lime, cilantro, red onion, bell pepper and habanero served with tortilla chips. This was the perfect shared plate for an appetizer because the fish was super fresh and light on the stomach, so you aren't left feeling stuffed before your main. Also, nothing beats fresh fish ceviche with a simple lime squeeze for that nice citrus aftertaste.  Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Following the trend of fresh fish, my friend had the mussels with mustard crema, beer, garlic, shallots, parsley and grilled ciabatta. It was a simple-sounding dish but the focus was definitely on the fresh taste of the mussels and the beer, garlic and mustard crema were the perfect flavors to slurp with the mussels î but even better to dip the ciabatta bread into after finishing the mollusks.† Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus I wanted to mix it up and venture out of seafood for my main so I went for the Wagyu burger with white cheddar, Valentina aioli, caramelized onions, house pickles and arugula on a brioche bun with a side of fries. Wow, the burger was a heavenly medium rare. It was the kind of burger that melts in your mouth and is so juicy you can't put it back down on the plate. My favorite part was definitely the caramelized onions because they were just sweet enough and added so much flavor, especially with the melted, gooey white cheddar. We debated skipping on dessert because we had a good amount of food throughout the day, but I am so glad we found that secret room for dessert! Our last dish in Ventura was the pot de cr√®me with dark chocolate mousse, crumbled nuts and orange whipped cream. For the first time, I tried to eat a dessert really slowly to savor the taste because it was that good. I am the biggest fan of dark chocolate so this was perfect for me. The dark chocolate mousse was perfectly rich and light at the same time. Adding the orange whipped cream was definitely the right move because orange and dark chocolate is a perfect pair. Rumfish y Vino ended our food adventures in Ventura on a very good note! I hope that I've made you hungry to go to Ventura because these spots are waiting for you!

on-the-menu,HKSA's Annual Lunar New Year Night Market,13-Feb-20,12:04 AM,"['Liliana Linan', 'Khanh Phan']",https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/hksas-annual-lunar-new-year-night-market/,"To celebrate the Lunar New Year, UC Santa Barbara's Hong Kong Student Association (a club open to all students aimed at celebrating Hong Kong culture) hosted a Lunar New Year Night Market filled with food, games, dance performances and music. This year, the annual event took place on Friday, Jan. 31 from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. at Storke Plaza and consisted of 13 different vendors.† Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus I arrived around 9:30, and although the festival was set to end at 10:30, many vendors were running low on food. The setup was very cute, with the vendors snaking around to form a òU' shape and lights hanging in the tents. Everyone looked happy to be celebrating Chinese culture, and Asian pop music was blasting as I looked at the food selections available. I then bought seven tickets for $1 each and began my journey for desserts. I was able to try the Hokkaido milk tea (without boba because there was none left), mochi and an egg tart. The Hokkaido milk tea was $3, which is a fairly good price, but was smaller than regular boba cups. It had a sweet, coconut flavor and was very satisfying once the ice cooled the drink down. The egg tart was also $3 and had a nice, light egg filling, but the pastry was a bit too hard. My friend really enjoyed the egg tart, but for me, it was a bit too eggy for a dessert. Lastly, I ordered the mochi and I had to wait a bit for it to cook î but once it was finished, I tried it with both Nutella and red bean. It was very chewy and hot, and it was my favorite item of the night. Both the Nutella and red bean spreads took the plain mochi to a whole new level, more so than if I had only eaten it with honey.† Khanh Phan / Daily Nexus For savory food, vendors were selling Chinese barbecue, curry, kimbap and carbonara rice cake. Barbecue always catches my attention because it was a classic night festival market snack for me growing up in Garden Grove, California. They had eggs, shrimp, beef and fish cakes to barbecue on their charcoal grill. Their egg barbecue wasn't just hard-boiled eggs on a wooden skewer, however. Instead, they had to shake up the raw egg to ensure the egg yolk and the egg white mixed. This mixture is boiled and then grilled. I had the beef skewers for $6, which were fatty and flavorful from the fat and the light marinade of soy sauce. The meat would have been great with a dipping sauce on the side.† UCSB's Korean American Student Association was selling kimbap, Korean handrolls with fillings of beef, avocado and fish cake. The kimbap was incredible, packed with flavor from the beef and crunchy textures from the carrots and other vegetables. The avocado in the avocado kimbap was buttery and reminiscent of avocado sushi rolls. They were much better than the ones I had in Korean grocery stores back in Orange County.† Overall, the Night Market was a great place to celebrate the Lunar New Year, as well as eat homemade food at a great price in a chill atmosphere. It was great to immerse myself in my childhood activity again of going to festivals with family and indulging in cute finger food. I weaved through the vendors and festive students practicing their calligraphy once more before leaving the lively scene and going back to UCSB.

Quite frankly, nothing says I love youù more than gifting a Valentine's Day treat to your partner, considering that they are sweeter than chocolate.† Today I invite you to travel around the globe with me and take a look at dishes in other countries that couples are swooning over on this affectionate holiday.† Ruhika Nandy / Daily Nexus Great Britain: Chocolate is still an essential food item for the British, but that is only after loving couples finish indulging in delicious, raw oysters. Specifically, they eat Pacific oysters, which are produced on farms, instead of the native oysters that are available year-round î because regular oysters are just not sufficient for your special Valentine. China: Valentine's Day is kind of a big deal in China, considering that the country dedicated a festival to celebrate this special occasion. The festival is called Qiqiao (Qixi), and during this festival, both single and taken women will put on new clothes and pray to the Vega star for wisdom and sophistication (and maybe for Mr. Right if they are single). Of course, it would be neglectful not to mention the delicious Qiaoguo, a traditional pastry at the festival that symbolizes intelligence and ingenuity. The fried pastry comes in various shapes, has a sweet sesame filling and can be given to your significant other, friends and even parents-in-law. Mexico: Valentine's Day in Mexico is called The Day of Love and Friendshipù, or El D√≠a del Amor y la Amistad.† In addition to sweet candies as alternatives to chocolate, another typical Valentine's day dish is Pibil Pollo, a Yucatan roast chicken dish with a hint of achiote paste, a popular seasoning in Mexican cuisine. With the bright red color of the achiote, the smell of citrus, garlic and habanero pepper, and the softness of a well-roasted drumstick, this dish is surely going to melt the heart (and taste buds) of your amante.† Italy: Besides being the origin of this heart-throbbing holiday, Italy is also known for its exquisite cuisine. Therefore, one should not expect anything less than visionary from the Italians' celebration of La Festa degli Innamorati (The Day of Lovers). There are multiple festivals around the country on this day for lovebirds to celebrate their devotion to each other. As aforementioned, chocolate is quite a popular item around the world on Valentine's Day, but because we are in the country where publicly announcing your endless love is commonplace, chocolate gifts need to be on a different level. A popular variation of Valentine's chocolate is called Baci Perugina, little chocolate kisses with cherries and love notes inside. Some other dishes that are popular on the Valentine's menu include the following: Spaghetti Alla Carbonara (pasta with egg, hard cheese and pork), Osso Buco (braised beef with vegetables and broth with white wine) and Penne all'Arrabbiata (penne pasta with signature tomato sauce, garlic and red peppers). Argentina: Bueno Aires in Argentina is South America's symbol of romance, and they do not take Valentine's day lightly. As a matter of fact, they decided to make Valentine's Day into Valentine's week! Usually, this week ends with a Friendship Day. Since Valentine's Day is a relatively new holiday in Buenos Aires, the cuisine has novel concepts. For example, some popular appetizers and meals are empanadas (fried flour pastry with beef feelings), revuelto gramajo (a hash brown dish with cheese, potatoes, eggs and vegetables) and morcilla (blood sausage made with pork, rice and fat). Belgium: Belgium is famous for its chocolate, since chocolate is an important tradition on Valentine's Day. But if you want to wake up your sweet tooth with a dessert that is both easy on the eyes, flavorful and full of interesting texture, a Belgian waffle would be the best choice. Belgian waffles are a lot thicker than other countries' waffles. Made with sweet yeast dough and crystallized sugar on top,† the waffles are also more chewy and dense, making each bite better than the next.† Egypt: A popular main dish that is present in many holidays in Egypt, including Valentine's Day, is called Fattah (beef or lamb meat served with rice, bread and vinegar/tomato sauce). It is more common to have lamb as the protein instead of beef when there is a special holiday. On top of that, Egyptians also enjoy a non-caffeinated drink called rose petal white coffee.ù The drink does not contain any coffee in it î only the juice of a thousand rose petals mixed with hot water and a brown sugar cube. The drink will surely help maintain an intimate atmosphere among lovebirds.† Valentine's Day is a beautiful holiday that celebrates not only love but also friendship and kinship. This holiday brings everyone closer together and gives everyone a great opportunity to remind their loved ones how much they mean to them. Furthermore, I would like to add that most of these dishes pair well with a glass of wine, but you might not need it î after all, that special someone's smile is already enough to make you drunk in love.

on-the-menu,Five Valentine's Day Food Destinations,13-Feb-20,1:27 AM,['Shelby Guy'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/five-valentines-day-food-destinations/,"Valentine's Day is coming up soon and with a holiday that celebrates relationships and love, many restaurants can make the perfect destination for a romantic date. If you are planning on taking your significant other out this year, here is a list of options for those with both picky palates and price-sensitive wallets. Each of these five restaurants is located on State Street and is the perfect option for a Valentine's Day meal or snack. The ranking of each place is dependent on four factors: cost, portion size, ambiance and taste.†† Emily Liu / Daily Nexus Santa Barbara Craft Ramen Cost: Average Portion Size: Large Ambiance: Very casal† Taste: Why aren't you there already? Santa Barbara Craft Ramen is arguably the best ramen place in Santa Barbara. Just by looking at it, you wouldn't expect this tiny ramen shop across the street from Himalayan Kitchen and Velvet Jones to possess such superb ramen. The secret is the bone broth, made from pork and beef bones, which is cooked for 24 hours. For a lighter side, they also serve amazing poke and rice bowls.† † Moby Dick Cost: Semi-expensive Portion Size: Average Ambiance: Semi-casual Taste: Best brunch on the pier Located at the end of the Santa Barbara pier, this fish house serves some of the best brunch I've had in a long time. Their handmade cocktails are to die for, and their lobster Benedict is worth every penny. Though a bit on the expensive side, it is well worth the price. This Valentine's Day, Moby Dick is also offering a special from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday.† † Patxi's Pizza Cost: Semi-expensive Portion Size: Large Ambiance: Very casual Taste: The sauce is to die for For those who want a more casual Valentine's Day, look no further than Patxi's Pizza. Located down the street from the Metropolitan Metro 4 Theatre, Patxi's offers the perfect end to a movie and pizza night or a great start to a night out on State Street. Specializing in Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, Patxi's puts their own spin on a classic recipe with a sauce that rivals any marinara that this writer has encountered. The pizza, however, comes with a bit of a wait î 25 minutes to be exact. If you are willing to wait, the pizza is well worth it. † 805 Boba Cost: Cheap Portion Size: Average Ambiance: Very casual Taste: Best boba in Santa Barbara If you want a break on your wallet and a calmer Valentine's Day, be sure to check out 805 Boba. This boba place offers some of the best mix-and-match options for tea and coffee, along with some of the sweetest brown-honey boba and rainbow jelly in Santa Barbara. They can get a bit of a line and are only open until 10 p.m., so if you and your significant other want a laid-back Valentine's Day with a nice dessert, this is the perfect place.† † Black Sheep Restaurant Cost: Expensive Portion Size: Small Ambiance: Very fancy Taste: Exquisite† For those who really want to impress this Valentine's Day, check out the Black Sheep Restaurant. A bit small on the portions and high on the price, this place is for those who want a truly fine-dining experience. The Black Sheep Restaurant offers the most delicious, creamy risotto du jour, and their bone marrow bruschetta is divine. The bone marrow becomes meat butter on a plate. So if you are looking for a nice night out and don't mind the price, this is the place to be † This list offers only a small sample of the many delicious restaurants on State Street, with much more ripe for discovery and sampling this Valentine's Day. If none of these options seem appealing, the Goleta and Santa Barbara areas hold a wide variety of restaurants to suit any taste and preference. However you decide to spend the day, either out on the town or indoors, I'm certain that you will be able to make the day a delicious one to remember.†

on-the-menu,Kaiju Brings Japanese Ramen and Curry to Isla Vista,20-Feb-20,12:01 AM,['Liliana Linan'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/92842/,"As an Los Angeles native, I eat a lot of ramen and I was very excited to hear about the opening of a new Japanese ramen and curry restaurant in our very own Isla Vista. Kaiju, the newest addition to I.V.'s food spots, recently replaced Hanamura and is already gaining a lot of traction, perhaps thanks to its advertisement on Facebook. Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus I arrived at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night, and there was a good amount of people there for a brand-new restaurant, but I didn't have to wait for a table. The restaurant itself is very well lit, with nice modern decor. The menu is simple, consisting of appetizers, curry and ramen.† I wanted to order fried octopus, but they ran out, and so I opted for the gyoza described as pork dumplings with garlic-sesame soy sauce, and the miso ramen. The prices are average, at $5.49 for the gyoza and $12.99 for the ramen. The gyoza was nice and crunchy, and the sauce was perfect for dipping because of its acidity. I enjoyed these dumplings, but they also tasted like the frozen Bibigo wontons I get from Costco.† Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus The miso ramen included a lot of toppings on paper but looked a bit emptier than I had anticipated when served. After the first slurp, I was immediately disappointed. I know I'm biased, but so far, nothing can beat LA ramen. The dish was too oily, and because it was served lukewarm, it cooled down very quickly. Overall, it just needed more flavor. The chashu (Japanese braised pork belly) was difficult to cut, and there was too little of every vegetable, especially the corn. I also wish there was an option to add spice, as I think that would bring up the flavor of the ramen.† In short, Kaiju is mediocre at best. I've always wanted to have Japanese curry, but I think I'll wait to try it at a different spot. 
Print Thanks for the review! i was not aware of the new place. With new restaurants, it's good to give them a few weeks to work out the kinks. I hope this place gets their act together. I'd love to have another great place to eat in IV.

on-the-menu,Su's Bowl: Authentic Chinese Cuisine,20-Feb-20,12:17 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/sus-bowl-authentic-chinese-cuisine/,"Su's Bowl opened its doors at the end of 2019, bringing a taste of authentic Chinese food to Isla Vista. It's located on Embarcadero Del Mar and replaced what used to be Wecook, another Chinese restaurant. I've been wanting to try Su's Bowl for a while since I had been hearing good things about the authenticity of the food, so I finally carved out the time to do so. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I visited the restaurant during lunch hour on a Friday, and there were plenty of tables open. The ordering style at Su's Bowl is designed so that customers simply mark off the dishes they want on a paper menu and hand it to the waiters. The restaurant has a vast variety of Chinese dishes to choose from including Szechuan dishes, sizzling pots and an assortment of different noodles and fried rice. I was eating with a friend, and we decided to share the Traditional Taiwanese braised beef noodle and the Chinese burger with lamb meat. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The beef noodle soup was pretty tasty compared to my relatively low standards of Asain food in I.V. The broth was flavorful and not watery at all, as I could taste the various spices they used in the soup. The noodles were chewy, and the meat and vegetables were decently good. The only criticisms I have are that I thought there was not enough bok choy, and some pieces of the meat were a little too fatty for my taste. However, this bowl of noodle soup was a good portion of food, as my friend and I barely finished the whole thing. I could definitely see myself ordering this again on a cold day to satisfy my cravings for a hot, steamy bowl of noodle soup. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I had never tried a Chinese burger before coming to Su's Bowl, and although I was skeptical at first, I'm glad I discovered this dish. A Chinese burger is a well-known street food that consists of your selection of meat sandwiched in between two pieces of flatbread. The bread was slightly toasted, giving off the perfect crunch, which contrasted the texture of the meat. The lamb meat was flavorful, and they were not stingy with their portions at all. I would warn those who do not like spicy food, as this burger is pretty hot despite the fact that it doesn't look spicy at all. Overall, Su's Bowl made a pretty good first impression on me. The food was tasty and as authentic as you can get in Santa Barbara. Additionally, the dishes were reasonably priced for its portion size. I would definitely recommend coming here with a friend so you don't spend too much money and so you can try a larger variety of dishes. The next time you're trying to decide what to eat in I.V., give Su's Bowl a try. With such a huge number of dishes on their menu, there's bound to be something that you enjoy!

on-the-menu,The Best Deals for Santa Barbara Restaurant Week,27-Feb-20,12:09 AM,['Alexandra Leal Silva'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/the-best-deals-for-santa-barbara-restaurant-week/,"Santa Barbara Restaurant Week started on Feb. 21, and for the next two weeks, Santa Barbara will be flooded with visitors from far and wide who have come to try some of the best food SB has to offer.

on-the-menu,Kyle's Protein Grill: Goleta's New Fast-Casual Restaurant,27-Feb-20,12:10 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/kyles-protein-grill-goletas-new-fast-casual-restaurant/,"Kyle's Kitchen recently launched its newest concept, Kyle's Protein Grill, bringing clean proteins served as plates, sandwiches and salads to Goleta. Kyle's Protein Grill is conveniently located next to Kyle's Kitchen î where Sup & Jus used to be î so it's just a short drive or bus ride away from campus and Isla Vista. I visited Kyle's Protein Grill during their soft opening on a Tuesday night and was immediately greeted by a bustling, lively atmosphere. Almost all the tables inside were full, but there was still lots of room on the patio, which was decorated with cute fairy lights. After scoping out the seating areas, I went to the counter to place my orders. The menu features three proteins: Mary's Free Range Organic Chicken, Harris Ranch Steak and Impossible Plant-Based Meatballs. I wanted to try a variety of dishes, so I opted for a meatball sub, an ahi tuna salad and a plate with steak as my protein, with chimichurri sauce and mashed potatoes and cauliflower as my two sides.† Photo Courtesy of Kyle's Kitchen I started with the salad, which I was really excited about because they were freshly packed in a Pop Bowl. The concept of these Take & Shakeù with regards to Kyle's Protein Grill bowls is really cool because the salads are compacted into an almost flat container, but you can expand the bowl, which gives you enough room to effortlessly toss your salad. They are perfect for a busy school or work day when you want a delicious meal on the go. As for the salad itself, the tuna, greens, mandarin oranges, wonton strips and sesame ginger dressing blended perfectly well, as none of the ingredients overpowered each other. I was able to get a perfect bite every time and this was a great start to my meal. Next, I tried the meatless meatball sub. The sandwich was made with brioche baguettes and I could tell that they were baked fresh because the crust was crispy while the inside of the bread was light and airy. The sandwich had been sitting while I ate my salad, so the marinara sauce soaked the bread, which made it even more soft and flavorful. This was my first time trying plant-based meatballs and while I didn't think they tasted like actual meat, they still were very savory and delicious.† Photo Courtesy of Kyle's Kitchen The protein plate was by far my favorite dish. The steak was cooked to medium perfection and the chimichurri sauce was to die for. The mashed potatoes were garlic-y and flavorful, and I especially liked that the cauliflower added a kick to it. This plate is perfect if you want to treat yourself to a tasty, well-balanced meal. If there's one thing that I would recommend trying at Kyle's Protein Grill, it's the steak and chimichurri. Overall, Kyle's Protein Grill was a big hit in my book. I love the variety and customizability of the dishes because you can tailor your meal to fit your personal diet or taste preferences. I also appreciate how much space the restaurant has; it offers tons of indoor and outdoor seating, so don't be afraid to come with a big group of friends. I would definitely come back here to try different combinations of their proteins and sides. If you want a taste preview of Kyle's Protein Grill before you go, their Take & Shakeù salads will be available soon at Silvergreens for you to grab in between classes!

on-the-menu,Fried Rice for One,27-Feb-20,12:13 AM,['Khanh Phan'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/fried-rice-for-one-recipe/,"With a batch of rice, prepared onions and garlic, anyone can make fried rice at least once a day. It only takes 15 minutes and can last for a whole week. This recipe is so incredibly easy and delicious that I cook it every day. You can also multiply the measurements and meal prep this fried rice, because this dish is still amazing even after reheating it in the microwave. If you make this recipe enough times, you can master it and won't even need to follow a recipe. Khanh Phan / Daily Nexus Fried rice is one of those recipes that you can make your own by adding or omitting ingredients that you like or have on hand. For example, if you're vegan, add crumbled tofu and omit the egg. If you don't have fresh onions or garlic, use powders. You can add spam, Chinese sausages or any other meat that's diced up. For the veggies, my basics are frozen peas and corn, but you can add the traditional carrots, scallions or chives. If you choose to add carrots, saut√© diced carrots in a pan first because it takes longer to cook and then add them into the main pan when you add the other veggies in. Corn isn't used in traditional fried rice recipes, but it is essential in fried rice for me.† For the rice, it's best to use rice that's at least a day old for the best texture. I actually prefer my rice to be hard and dry because the egg and moisture from the veggies reconstitute it into an amazingly crispy yet fluffy bite. I use cold rice that has hardened in the fridge, so I have to crumble it into fine grains because it sticks together. If it's fresh rice, just spread the rice out in a thin layer so the moisture can evaporate. For the seasoning, I try to pack in the salt.† For the chicken base, I use Better Than Bouillon Roasted Chicken Base. If you're vegan, you can still enjoy this dish because their vegetable base is also up to par with their chicken base. If you don't have measuring cups at home, you can make this just as easily by eyeing it. Tip: Not all frozen corn is made equally. I've tried all the ones from Albertsons, Target, Ralph's and Trader Joe's, but the best one is C&W Petite White & Golden Corn from Albertsons.† Ingredients: Directions: Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,Stuffed and Fluffed With SB Restaurant Week,4-Mar-20,12:57 AM,['Alexandra Leal Silva'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-04/stuffed-and-fluffed-with-sb-restaurant-week/,"Over the past two weeks, I have had the pleasure of hopping around Santa Barbara and trying a bunch of spots that participated in Santa Barbara Restaurant Week! With over 30 restaurants participating, there seems to be a never-ending stream of choices, no matter what you are craving. I wanted to taste as many cuisines as possible without taking too big of a hit on the old wallet. Two experiences that especially stood out in terms of taste and cost efficiency were Chase Restaurant and Eureka! Chase Restaurant Located on State Street, Chase Restaurant is the perfect location to take a date or treat yourself! The restaurant itself is very cozy with fairy lights outlining the space. The decor reminded me of Christmas time, and with a rose on every table, the restaurant felt laced with the feeling of l'amour. Seemingly popular with folks of all ages, Chase Restaurant was buzzing for a Thursday night with wait staff hustling back and forth, all with a notable smile. Upon arriving and being seated, my date and I looked over our menus and gladly accepted the one for SB Restaurant Week. With the average pasta entree costing $20, we were thrilled to order from their prix fixe menu that offered three courses for only $25!† Chase Restaurant has an impressive wine list for all the sommeliers out there with lists of Interesting Whites, Interesting Reds and so on. They offered several cocktails as well which could be ordered from the table or their fully stacked bar.† We both started with a salad; I went with the caesar and he went with the house. When ordering, the waitress told me that folks constantly raved about the Caesar salad due to the fantastic dressing. I immediately knew what she meant. The dressing was creamy and well-seasoned, while not overpowering the salad. I found it to be the perfect appetizer before what I imagined would be a heavy entree. My date ended up finishing my salad for me and claimed that it was by far his favorite part of the entire experience.† Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus For the second course, my date went for the lasagna, while I chose their famous chicken piccata with fettuccine alfredo. Both dishes came out promptly and seemed to be the most popular dishes of the evening. The lasagna was well-cooked and quite cheesy but the sauce could have been more flavorful. The chicken piccata was moist and well-cooked. It had a gorgeous golden brown sear on it and the capers were delectable. Similar to the lasagna dish, the only problem I found with it was the sauce. Though some may be more inclined toward lemon, it has the tendency to overwhelm my palette. The presence of lemon was evident in the sauce and at times proved to be too much. However, I loved the inclusion of the lemon once I began eating the pasta. The fettuccine was al dente and the sauce was so incredibly good. It was obviously more of a cream base than butter and was rich in flavor and texture. The lemon element helped cut through the deep sauce and made it possible for me to nearly finish my meal.† Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus For dessert, we were sad to hear that the restaurant had run out of tiramisu by 7:30 p.m. due to its popularity. We decided to each get one of the remaining desserts: he chose the New York raspberry cheesecake and I went for a classic cannoli. The presentation of both desserts was so effortlessly appetizing, it was hard to ruin it by eating them. The New York cheesecake had zigzags of raspberry sauce and the cannoli mirrored it with zigzags of chocolate sauce. The cheesecake was creamy and the lightness of the whipped cream combined with the texture of the fresh raspberries created a party of flavor! The cannoli was the definition of decadent. A perfectly fried cannoli shell housed a wonderful cannoli cream and puffs of whipped cream with chocolate chips and powdered sugar that created a sugar dream.† Overall, the Chase Restaurant experience was tasty and for $25 a person provided more food than I could have imagined. It's a beautiful location to spend quality time with someone you love and has food that you will fall in love with.† Eureka! Over on the other side of State Street was Eureka!, a casual burger joint that provides anything but average. For also $25 a person, if you have a craving for burgers and fries but want to up your game, Eureka! is the place for you. Though this may seem like a more simplified menu in comparison to some other locations participating in SB Restaurant Week, the food is anything but simple. Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus My partner and I started our meal by both ordering the truffle cheese fries. Truffle salt, parmesan and green onion cascade on top of golden fries that you can smell as soon as they hit the table. The truffle fries are accompanied by a white truffle cheese sauce that can only be described as heavenly. Though I would return for the entire menu, I am one day post-meal and I am already eager to go back and have another order of those fries. We could not express how delicious this entree was and the flavor profile was on another level.† Alexandra Leal Silva / Daily Nexus For the second course, we ordered a Fresno Fig Burger and a Cowboy Burger, both medium-rare. Though they both come with fries, we decided to upgrade our side for $2 and order side salads instead. There isn't a choice on which salad to order but they do offer the dressing options of either ranch or lemon vinaigrette. We decided to try one of both! The burgers came within a reasonable time and we could not wait to dig in. The Fresno Fig Burger, featuring a fig marmalade, melted goat cheese, arugula and a spicy porter mustard, was everything we wanted it to be and more. The burger itself was juicy and cooked perfectly. The fig spread and goat cheese were delicious and the bun was buttery and beautifully grilled. The Cowboy Burger featured bacon, shoestring onion rings and a barbeque beer sauce. The bacon was crispy and the onions were a tasty touch with a nice bite. The barbeque sauce complimented the cheddar cheese very well and the burger was, again, juicy and exactly how I wanted it to be.† When it was finally time for dessert, we weren't sure we had any room left but we powered through. We got one of each option: the Bonfire Stout Brownie and Bourbon Barrel Cake. Both desserts featured ice cream, a surprisingly nice palette cleanser. The Bonfire Stout Brownie featured charcoal ash and smoked paprika on its vanilla scoop offering an interesting flavor dynamic, especially when paired with the brownie. The Bourbon Barrel Cake featured a caramel made with, you guessed it, bourbon. It mixed very nicely with the vanilla ice cream and had pecans laced throughout that offered a nice crunch.† Overall, Eureka! offered a fantastic meal for a fantastic price. The atmosphere was casual and fun and provided a nice space to take family or a group of friends. We both took home leftovers that we can't wait to dig into during lunch and have decided that we have to go back soon.† No matter what you choose, I am sure you'll find an unforgettable experience during SB Restaurant Week. Restaurant Week runs till Friday, March 6 so get out there and get tasting!

on-the-menu,Six Healthy Essentials for Surviving Dead Week,5-Mar-20,12:22 AM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/six-healthy-essentials-for-surviving-dead-week/,"Winter quarter is quickly coming to an end, which means the excitement of spring quarter is coming ahead; however, so does the pressure of finals week. Whether you prefer camping out at the lib, studying at home or posting up at a coffee shop during dead week, here is a list of tips for staying energized while you begin studying next week. Photo courtesy of Piqsels.com 1. Grab a yerba mate or cold brew from the Arbor The first thing I like to do before settling in at the library is to get some source of caffeine. Fortunately, the Arbor is stocked with a variety of yerba mates, energy drinks and my personal favorite, cold brews. The window outside also caters to coffee lovers by having made-to-order coffee options. 2. Try studying with gum. During my first round of finals last year, I found myself going through several packs of gum in just a few days. Gum not only gives me something to do but it also keeps my brain working. The Arbor has several different options you can buy for cheap prices. Just make sure that if you study with gum, you also take your tests with it so you're in the same mind space! 3. Drink lots of water throughout the day. Nothing makes doing schoolwork all day more miserable than being dehydrated. Dehydration not only makes you more tired but also less focused. For this reason, I always make sure to have my Hydro Flask on me and consciously refill it throughout the day.† 4. Pack healthy snacks beforehand It's vital to stay nourished as you prepare for finals, which begins with eating healthy foods. While there are a variety of healthy options offered at the Arbor, in order to save some money and avoid being tempted by the plethora of junk food, I suggest bringing snacks from home to eat throughout the day. Some great options include fruit, like an apple or banana, almonds, carrots and hummus or granola bars.† 5. Make time for exercise, if possible. I always find that I am more productive once I have been active early in the day. During dead week, I try to make working out early in the morning a priority so I can spend the rest of the day focused on my schoolwork. This can be a great way to start the day with natural energy. 6. Eat a healthy breakfast to start the day right. Although many college students don't eat breakfast regularly, during high-stress weeks, it can be a beneficial way to get natural energy before starting to study. Easy options may include instant oatmeal, yogurt or toast with peanut butter or avocado. Hopefully at least one of these tips can be easily implemented into your routine going into dead week. While schoolwork can be grueling, it's important to put our health first in order to give our best performance during finals week!

on-the-menu,Sunset Dinner at Boathouse at Hendry's Beach,5-Mar-20,12:53 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/sunset-dinner-at-boathouse-at-hendrys-beach/,"Located right by the ocean, Boathouse at Hendry's Beach is an upscale seafood restaurant known for its delicious brunch and beautiful outdoor patio. After years of wanting to try Boathouse, I finally got to go for dinner on a Friday night. I made a reservation a few weeks ahead of time because I heard that the wait time can skyrocket to almost an hour during peak hours. Unfortunately, none of the tables on the patio were available, but my friend and I were seated by the window with a panoramic view of the beach.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus We decided to start off with coconut shrimp, which came with four pieces of Mexican white prawns rolled in coconut flakes with a sweet chili lime dipping sauce on the side. The prawns were huge and the coconut flakes were lightly fried, making each bite very satisfying. The dipping sauce complemented the shrimp well, but it wasn't anything special. Although I enjoyed this appetizer, I expected more and I would probably go for another starter next time. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus For my main dish, I opted for a Boathouse specialty, the cioppino. The dish consisted of a spicy tomato broth filled with mussels, clams, fresh fish, shrimp, scallops and stone crab claw and was topped with two pieces of mesquite-grilled garlic bread. I'm pretty indecisive and always want to try a little bit of everything, so this was the perfect dish for me. I loved the variety of all the seafood and I appreciated that they put equal portions of each type of seafood in the dish because it made me feel like I was really getting my money's worth. The garlic bread was very savory, as expected, and served as the perfect complement to the tomato broth, as it soaked up its flavor very nicely. The portion size of this dish is fairly large, as I wasn't able to finish everything and ended up taking it home. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus My friend had the pan-seared scallops which came with lobster and crab risotto, broccolini and spicy tomato basil broth. The scallops were seared to a perfect golden-brown and tasted very fresh, but my favorite part of this dish was actually the risotto. The rich, velvety texture paired so well with the umami flavors that we couldn't get enough of it. The portions for this dish were also pretty sizable, although we didn't end up with any leftovers. Overall, I had a great experience for my first time at Boathouse. Dining with the beach right next to you during sunset is a perfect way to end the week and I'd love to come back to try their brunch and happy hour. If there's one thing I'd recommend before visiting the restaurant, it would be to choose your clothes carefully because one slip up could easily get your white shirt stained with tomato broth, which is exactly what happened to me.

on-the-menu,Ring in the Spring Season with Starbucks' New Drinks,11-Mar-20,12:52 AM,['Liliana Linan'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/ring-in-the-spring-season-with-starbucks-new-drinks/,"Although spring officially begins on March 19, Starbucks has already unveiled its new menu for the warm season, which includes two bright and dairy-free iced drinks. Both the iced pineapple matcha and golden ginger drinks are made with coconut milk, a smart business move as consumers look for more dairy-free options. I tend to order solely coffee at Starbucks, but the choice to create colorful tea options for spring is fitting.† Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus I began with the golden ginger drink, which is described as Starbucks' golden ginger blend with turmeric essence shaken with flavors of pineapple and ginger, coconut milk and ice.ù At first glance, the drink is very pretty and bright yellow, like a nice sunny day served in a cup. I am a fan of both ginger and turmeric, which most people aren't, but the only way I can describe the taste of my first sip is how I imagine a Yankee Candle to taste. It did not taste like the sunshine and happiness I expected. It did have a fruity taste but was too sweet, as if Starbucks melted down yellow Starburst candies and added ginger. The ginger wasn't too strong, but prominent enough that if you dislike ginger, you would hate this drink. I wouldn't order it ever again, but it wasn't so unbearable that I couldn't drink it. It was very silky and refreshing but was the same as drinking over-sweetened and flavored water. Because of the coconut milk, the entire drink isn't overbearing, but it does leave a lingering taste in your mouth after.† After waiting a few minutes to cleanse my palette after the golden ginger drink, I tried the pineapple matcha. It was my first time ever having matcha, but I thought I'd like it because I do enjoy green tea. It contains the same pineapple ginger syrup as the golden ginger drink but, of course, its base is the Starbucks matcha tea blend. It was less smooth than its sister drink, but that is due to the natural grittiness of matcha powder. I admit the matcha and pineapple combination works very well together, but matcha itself is a powerful flavor and I thought it needed more pineapple flavor. I concluded that I am not the biggest matcha fan, so I wouldn't order this but any matcha lover who wants to mix up their usual order will adore this drink.† Overall, these two drinks are wonderful non-coffee and dairy-free options, as more and more people are reducing their milk intake because of climate or personal diet reasons. I do think Starbucks tends to focus more on the aesthetic looks of drinks than the taste, as we've seen in the past with their other colorful Instagram-worthy creations. Still, the coconut milk makes both of these new additions light and refreshing and perfect for the upcoming sunny spring days. Just remember not to bring your reusable cup for these colorful spring drinks, as Starbucks has stopped the use of personal containers due to coronavirus.

on-the-menu,The Perfect Mushroom Risotto,12-Mar-20,8:43 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-12/the-perfect-mushroom-risotto/,"If you feel like spending a little extra time cooking dinner, try out this creamy mushroom risotto recipe. Although we often associate risotto with upscale restaurants, it's actually very easy to make at home. The only setback is that you'll have to dedicate the time to constantly watch and continually stir the rice, but this mushroom risotto is filled with such delicious umami flavors that tasting the final product is sure to make all that time and effort worth it. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: After my first time making mushroom risotto, I realized that it's not difficult at all and you can make so many different variations of it! This recipe serves three and I also made steak as the protein to go along with the risotto, which made it the perfect dinner to end the day.

What if you are still hungry after dinner and all you can think about are delicious snacks? Needless to say, a growling stomach should not be a part of your productive studying. The snack list below will help keep your stomach quiet for late-night studying and your head elevated for the upcoming exams and projects.† Brea Spencer / Daily Nexus Chia seed pudding This snack is full of energy-boosting ingredients and on top of that, it is delicious and would definitely keep your stomach at ease so you could focus more on the exam material and less on your hunger. Chia seed puddings are also easy to make, and you could top off the puddings with your favorite choice of toppings, such as strawberries blueberries or sliced almonds. This is a great antioxidant source as you take on the challenges ahead of you like a champion.† Chicken Quesadillas This is a ridiculously uncomplicated dish packed with nutrients and the best thing is you can fully customize this dish by stuffing any ingredient your heart desires in a tortilla î the oozing melty cheese as you take your first bite, the taste of the savory chicken combined with the flattering smell of spices and the tortilla flour. Chicken Quesadillas are bound to make your heart happy and allow your mind to stop wandering about snacks.† Steamed Edamame† Edamame is a healthy, nutrient-rich snack, that is at the same time very easy to prepare and offers a refreshing taste. You could get 6 pounds of edamame at Costco for a very reasonable price, store it in your freezer and just take it out whenever your school work is about to make you lose your beans (pun intended!). Simply boil the edamame with salt water on a stove, or put it in the microwave for 3 minutes and you are good to go. Eat it while you are cramming lessons and let the firmness of the beans and the hint of sweetness and nuttiness help you destress.† Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich This snack is not only packed with flavors, but also with all your favorite childhood memories. With only three ingredients that you probably already have in your fridge, this quick and easy to make snack is perfect if you want to feel nostalgic and focused at the same time for your late-night study session. Smoothie† This is a great idea if you have fruits laying around your house, like bananas, strawberries, apples, blueberries or mango (although the smoothie should be prepared in the afternoon to avoid the wrath of your housemates).† Add all the fruits in the mixer along with milk and ice and puree away. A smoothie is a great way to provide vitamins and hydrate your skins and nails, while at the same time taste sweet and revitalizing. Veggies and Hummus A classic snack during the day should also make a great snack during late at night. Veggies and hummus beautifully represent this saying. If you have mini carrots, broccoli, celery and hummus in your fridge, grab them. Enjoy the stimulating feeling of the veggies' crunchiness and the smoothness of the creamy hummus paste dancing inside your mouth. Now you are ready to keep on learning! Late-night snacks are usually hot and sugary, which can feel very comforting, but at the same time, might make you want to unplug your laptop and jump right into the sweet paradise of your soft bed and pillows. The above list consists of foods that are energetic and essential to provide your body with rich nutrients that help boost your energy and immune system. The mentioned snacks are also relatively cheap and easy to make. They are also great for keeping you focused and healthy throughout the difficult weeks ahead!

I didn't hate it as much as I did taking medicine, but I definitely didn't enjoy its overwhelming spice and bitter taste either.

Located in downtown Santa Barbara, Norton's offers its famous pastrami sandwiches along with various other delicious menu items such as corned beef sandwiches, mozzarella sticks, jalape√±o bottle caps and fried pickles. The interior of the deli is quite small and narrow with only a few tables and a countertop to sit at, so I would arrive at non-peak hours if you'd like to find a seat.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Their menu is pretty diverse with at least three or four varieties of pastrami, corned beef, Philly cheesesteak, grilled chicken, cold subs, hot dogs and sandwich melts. I had a difficult time deciding which sandwich to choose because they all sounded so tasty but I eventually settled on the Mom's PLT, which was made of crispy pastrami, chipotle mayo, lettuce and tomato on sourdough bread. The sandwich was loaded with each ingredient, but it wasn't overfilling to the point where the meat or veggies were falling out in each bite. The sandwich was like an elevated version of a classic BLT, although it was a little greasy. However, the sandwich also came with a side of a pickle that helped cut the grease from the buttered sourdough bread and savory pastrami.† Norton's also has a lot of different options if you don't want their classical pastrami sandwich. The deli offers gluten-free bread as a substitute for only $1 extra and if you're not a fan of sandwiches at all but want to try the best pastrami in town, Norton's also has pastrami chili cheese fries. Overall, I had high expectations for the sandwich and it definitely met them. The PLT served as a great lunch after my morning shift at work and I would definitely come back to try other menu items, especially the corned beef or Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.

Charcuterie boards are one of the easiest snacks to throw together and are perfect for the upcoming days at home. Whether you're binging a Netflix series, tuning into your online lecture or playing a board game, the mix of cheese, meat, crackers and fruits on a charcuterie board makes the perfect treat for any occasion.†  When making and enjoying your charcuterie board, the first and most important step is to wash your hands before touching the food. Depending on your preference and availability, you can also use food-safe gloves, such as clear plastic or vinyl gloves, when assembling your charcuterie. Although the platter's formal name is charcuterie board,ù you don't have to use an actual board. You can use whatever you have on hand such as a large plate, cutting board or a small table lined with plastic wrap. The next step is assembling your ingredients. To feed four to seven people, I recommend three types of cheeses, three types of meat, two types of crackers or bread and two types of fruits. Although this seems like a large amount of food, some grocery stores offer pre-arranged selections of cheese and meats in smaller portions for charcuterie. When arranging your charcuterie, I recommend spreading out the different ingredients. This allows the charcuterie to look more visually appealing because of the variations of colors and shapes.† Once your charcuterie is fully assembled, I highly recommend taking a photo for your Instagram. Before devouring, make sure that everyone enjoying has freshly washed hands and an appetite!

on-the-menu,Homemade Fresh Strawberry Milk,30-Mar-20,7:00 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-30/homemade-fresh-strawberry-milk/,"Strawberry season is finally here and what better way to celebrate than with a refreshing cup of strawberry milk? Fresh strawberry milk is a very popular beverage in Korea, and I've been wanting to make it myself ever since watching some very aesthetically pleasing YouTube videos of baristas making this drink in Korean cafes. A lot of recipes online require blending or boiling the fruit to create the strawberry syrup, but this recipe doesn't require any of that, which is perfect for lazy college students because that means there are fewer dishes to wash! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients (for four servings): Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The great thing about this recipe is that it really doesn't require that much effort and you can customize it by using different types of milk. I used almond milk because I try to stay away from consuming too much dairy, but I've heard that milk alternatives that are less water-based, like coconut milk, work best for this recipe. Nevertheless, this is a super easy beverage recipe that you can make in the mornings and enjoy throughout the week. If you can't finish all four servings of this strawberry milk (I don't recommend finishing all of it in one day), the syrup can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days.†

on-the-menu,Homemade Green Onion Pancakes,2-Apr-20,10:30 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-02/homemade-green-onion-pancakes/,"Being stuck at home for spring break gave me the motivation to cook new dishes and with all that time on my hands, it was the perfect opportunity to try to make one of my favorite childhood foods: green onion pancakes. Green onion pancakes, or scallion pancakes, are a savory Chinese flatbread folded with oil and minced scallions. Unlike a traditional American pancake, green onion pancakes are made with dough instead of batter and they are pan-fried to create crispy edges with chewy yet flakey textures on the inside. I used to eat green onion pancakes all the time when I was growing up and when I crave them, I usually buy the frozen packages of pre-made pancakes from my local Asian market and reheat them in the pan. After doing some research on a variety of different green onion pancake recipes, I thought it would be fun to try and make them from scratch and see how they compared to a restaurant or store-bought green onion pancake, and this is the recipe I used to make two green onion pancakes. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus This recipe took me two attempts to make because during my first attempt, my water was not at the correct temperature and I did not knead the dough long enough which made it very difficult to work with. After throwing away my first dough attempt and starting on a second batch, however, I realized how important it was to use cold water and knead the dough until it was no longer sticky. It took around an hour to make two green onion pancakes and they were not nearly as flakey as the ones I get at the restaurant or supermarket, so the final verdict is that I would probably just continue purchasing the pre-made pancakes from the grocery store. However, it was actually super fun making them at home because the recipe requires simple ingredients that I already had in my kitchen so if you have extra time on your hands, I would encourage you to try it out and experiment with this recipe!
Print Judging from the final pic, they need to be fried in more oil! the Korean green onion pancake is a good alternative to the Chinese one, although it's chewy rather than flakey but way easier to make!

One of the most exciting parts of exploring this city was the great variety of restaurants to choose from. A major standout of the weekend had to be Underbelly, a modern ramen spot located in the heart of North Park, San Diego. Although traveling may not be possible at the minute, Underbelly is a great place to remember for future getaways or for any San Diego locals! Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus From the street, Underbelly is hard to miss with its fire-lit outdoor courtyard with seating and a bar. Upon walking in, guests are greeted by a worker handing them a lengthy menu full of various ramen and rice bowl options. Although the tofu and vegetable teriyaki bowl looked irresistible, I had come in with ramen on my mind. I ended up ordering the Farmers Market ramen, the only vegetarian option for ramen. It came with vegetable broth, seasonal vegetables (which included carrots and cauliflower), bean sprouts, scallions, seaweed and sesame seeds, but I also chose to add eggplant-wrapped tofu.† As we sat down, we noticed that there was a self-serve water station with options for still or sparkling. We were very impressed with the endless amounts of sparkling water offered for free. Our table was already ready with chili paste and other toppings for when our ramen arrived. In the meantime, I split an appetizer of shiitake mushroom kabobs with one of my friends. They were incredible, and the small serving size left us both wishing that we had ordered more than one.† Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus For her entree, one of my friends also opted to get the Farmers Market ramen but chose to add pulled pork and a soft-boiled egg, which she claimed to have added the perfect amount of flavor and protein. My other friend chose the Thai Curry Ramen, which she enjoyed but barely made a dent in because of how filling it was.† After finishing eating, we were all stuffed to the brim and were very satisfied with our meals. While the food was to die for, what really made this restaurant special was its unique setting. Although it was the beginning of March and still chilly outside, we were kept comfortable by the fireside tables and heaters around the patio. The sparkling water was also a very memorable touch. For any San Diego locals who have moved home for spring quarter, Underbelly is still accepting takeout orders during the shelter-in-place! Although we must try to stay in our homes as much as possible, Underbelly offers the option to order online and have your order delivered to your vehicle upon arriving. Otherwise, we must wait until students can safely return to Isla Vista, because Underbelly is worth the short drive from there to San Diego!

on-the-menu,An Essential Breakfast Carb: Crunchy French Toast,9-Apr-20,12:43 AM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-09/an-essential-breakfast-carb-crunchy-french-toast/,"French toast is a classic brunch item, so why not elevate it and make it even better? After eating the crunchy French toast at Blu Jam Cafe in Los Angeles a few months ago, I was inspired to attempt making this dish on my own. Although I love French toast in its original form, the added crunchy exterior made the brunch dish even more delicious because of the texture contrast between the crust and the soft, fluffy bread. To make crunchy French toast, you'll need all the ingredients for regular French toast, plus some cornflakes or Frosted Flakes. If you have a big sweet tooth, I'd go for the Frosted Flakes for the extra sugar. But I also think cornflakes work just fine, especially if you're serving the toast with maple syrup. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: I'd definitely recommend this if you're craving something sweet on the weekends. There are only two extra steps if you compare this to making regular French toast, so it isn't difficult at all and it's sure to give you a great start to your day!

This recipe only calls for a few simple ingredients that I already had at home, and the sauce is totally customizable. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The only thing I would say is to be cautious of how much soy sauce you put into the sauce because the garlic already makes it pretty savory. If you're scared that you'll go overboard with the soy sauce, use low-sodium soy sauce to make sure it's not too salty. Other than that, these chicken wings turned out great and served as a terrific appetizer for my lunch. I paired the wings with some Filipino spaghetti, and it was the perfect weekend meal!

However, a dish as simple as this never fails to make my day, which is why I learned how to make wontons at home by myself. Although this recipe yields a whopping 70 wontons, you can definitely cut the measurements in half to make less, but I find that making a lot at once saves you more time in the future.† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus If you want to eat your wontons immediately like I did, you can enjoy them with some Asian chili oil or make wonton noodle soup. To make the soup, you'll just need some egg noodles, bok choy, green onions, ginger and chicken broth. Bring the chicken broth, ginger and green onions to a boil in a pot and then throw in your wontons, noodles and bok choy. Cook for two to three minutes or until the wontons float to the top and enjoy! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I love making my own wontons because it makes it so much more convenient to cook up a quick lunch or dinner when I don't feel like cooking later on. Wrapping your own wontons during the quarantine is also a great way to kill time and learn something new!

on-the-menu,Quarantine Kitchen: How To Make Challah Bread,26-Apr-20,12:01 AM,['Hannah Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/quarantine-kitchen-how-to-make-challah-bread/,"Hey all you goys and girls! For some of us, adjusting to a new normal of minimal human contact and a lot of indoor time has led us down the path of obsessively cooking (I for one am guilty of making a massive three-course meal for six people). After seeing post after post of people making bread from home, I decided that I wanted to jump on the bandwagon. I chose to try challah for my foray into bread-making, as I have lately been feeling quite nostalgic for the comfort of the past, so making this is a way I can feel close to my family without physically being with them.† For those who have never had it, challah is a braided loaf of bread, noteworthy for its slight sweetness and fluffy texture. It is a focal point of Jewish cuisine, used to celebrate major holidays and the Sabbath.† Challah is an ideal bread to bake if, like me, you demand (near) instant gratification. Unlike many breads that require a full day of rising time, the challah dough takes less than two hours to rise and yields a large loaf in comparison to the amount of flour the recipe requires.† Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: Lightly whisk together the two packets of yeast with the warm water and let sit for 10 minutes. While the yeast sits, combine the flour, sugar, honey, vegetable oil and egg yolks in a large bowl.† Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Combine the two mixtures together and stir with a wooden spoon until dough forms. This can be done by hand or with a standing mixer fixed with a dough hook. Then, on a floured surface, knead the dough for five minutes.† Once the dough is kneaded, place it in an oiled bowl and cover with Saran Wrap (I used beeswax paper in lieu of Saran Wrap, and if you don't have either, uncovered is okay, too). Let the bowl sit in a warm area for one hour. After an hour, punch down the dough and cover it for another 45 minutes. Once the dough rises, place it onto a well-floured surface and cut it into three equal parts. Roll them out into long, thin strips. A rolling pin is not necessary; you can just shape them with your hands and let gravity do some of the work for you. Lay the strips out onto a baking sheet or parchment paper. I had neither, so I used a piece of oiled aluminium foil. This method can still work î albeit not as effectively as the former methods î but make sure the foil is well oiled, as mine got a bit stuck coming off. From there, pinch the top of the three strips together on one side. This will be the basis for our braid. Fold the strips over each other in an alternating pattern (just like how you would braid hair) until you reach the bottom. Pinch the ends together and tuck them into the bottom of the loaf.† Next, you're going to take the last remaining egg and lightly whisk it together in a bowl. This is the egg wash that gives the bread its color and slight sheen when it bakes. If you, unlike me, have a rubber brush, simply dip the brush into your egg wash and paint it over the top of your loaf. However, if you're working with limited materials, like me, gently pour the egg wash in increments over the challah and use either your hands or a paper towel of sorts to evenly distribute the egg. Make sure that the egg doesn't get stuck in the grooves of the bread between the braided strips. Not having a brush no doubt made the process significantly messier, but it wasn't a detriment to the process. Sesame (or poppy) seeds often make for a nice appearance when sprinkled over the loaf, so feel free to dash an amount of your liking over the top of the dough. Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. I chose to do this after I applied the egg wash, rather than before, so the dough could have a few extra minutes to rise. Place the loaf in the oven for 25 minutes, after which you can assess if it needs more time. I chose to give the bread an extra five minutes for a crispier finish.† Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Et voil√†! Your very own challah loaf! While amazing on its own, challah is also versatile in its usage. Although it's great for sandwiches or toast, challah is the undisputed champion of French toast, as its hint of sweetness perfectly complements the breakfast staple.

I put some broccoli and mushrooms in the same baking tray as the tilapia fillets and served that on the side. Another dish I've made with the lemon-butter tilapia is pesto and mushroom linguine. They pair really well if you're looking for something more hearty.

With prolonged periods between grocery store trips, I often find myself going through my fresh produce quickly and leaving myself with grains, canned goods and nonperishables for weeks. Minestrone soup is a great way to make sure you're getting a proper veggie intake î and it freezes and reheats well, meaning you won't have to rely on eating canned beans every night.† Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Minestrone is great if you have any fresh vegetables you're worried about going bad; anything seasonal is a great addition.

For breakfast? Yes, trust me on this one. Not only does this breakfast salad look and taste amazing, it's the perfect way to start off your day on a healthy foot. It's chock-full of healthy greens and proteins, and the capers give it a nice salty twist. The proportions of ingredients in this salad are entirely up to you î use as much or as little of anything as you please! Laura Tucker / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Steps: If you're vegetarian or simply looking for a way to cut costs on this salad (smoked salmon can be a tad pricey), then I'd recommend substituting the salmon with some roasted red peppers. And if you're a big fan of capers like I am, try chopping them up really finely before adding them to the salad. It disperses the flavor more!

My favorite part of eating ramen is the savory egg and its creamy center, and since we can't go out to eat ramen anymore, I wanted to learn how to make them at home! I usually soft boil an egg to complement my instant ramen, but after learning how to properly make a marinated soft-boiled egg like they do it at restaurants, I can never go back to regular soft-boiled eggs! Marinating your eggs with soy sauce actually takes minimal ingredients, and you can make a whole batch at once. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: 6 eggs 2 teaspoons sesame seeds 3 garlic cloves, chopped 3 green onions, chopped 1 tablespoon white vinegar 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sugar or honey Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus The one extra step of making the soy sauce marinade really elevates the soft-boiled eggs, and it can be eaten with ramen, rice or even on its own! I've eaten it with some ground beef bulgogi rice bowls, and it was absolutely delicious. You can store the eggs in the fridge for a week, but you'll probably finish all of them before then anyway!

on-the-menu,Healthy Alternatives for Your Favorite Foods,5-Jun-20,1:18 PM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-05/94828/,"Sometimes eating healthy can seem daunting and unattainable because our favorite junk foods are just too good to resist. However, what if there was a way to eat healthy without giving up these foods? I am a strong advocate for moderation and I know that anything is okay every once in a while. But in case you simply can't resist reaching for your favorite junk food, here are some equally delicious alternatives you can try swapping them for! Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Pasta: Pasta is one of the most satisfying and easy dishes to make, so it may be disheartening to hear that it doesn't have much nutritional value. Luckily, almost all grocery stores now carry different kinds of pasta that are made from healthy bases like brown rice, black beans, lentils or even kale! My personal favorite is red lentil pasta because it still tastes great with almost any pasta sauce and is also super high in protein, so you don't need to feel guilty about low nutritional value. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Peanut Butter: If you're anything like me, you crave peanut butter at least once a day. Unfortunately, many of the name-brand peanut butters you see at stores like Skippy or Jif contain a long list of unhealthy ingredients like corn syrup solids, palm oil, sugars and many hard-to-pronounce chemicals. This not only takes away the healthy benefits of eating peanut butter but also makes it less nutritionally dense. A healthy alternative is getting organic peanut butter with the only ingredients being peanuts and maybe salt. All you need to do is stir it before eating and store it in the fridge to prevent oil separation. You can find these natural brands almost anywhere and I personally have grown to love the taste even more. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus † Chocolate: For anyone with a sweet tooth, candy bars are not your only dessert option. There are many other ways to satisfy your chocolate cravings while also getting its antioxidant benefits! The best alternative I have found is looking for dark chocolate bars with a high percentage of cacao. Typically, these bars contain very few ingredients, all of which are more natural than those you see on brand-name candy bars. Trader Joe's carries many different kinds that all taste great without being too unhealthy. Burgers: Being healthy doesn't mean you have to deprive yourself of this summertime favorite. There are little tweaks you can make to help make burgers healthy. For one, choosing to eat a burger patty without the bun and replacing it with a lettuce wrap can help make it a more nutritious meal. Adding some other veggies on top will help add back some flavor and make it customizable. If you want to further eliminate some of the extra fats, plenty of grocery stores now offer healthy plant-based patties! Fries: For many people, french fries can be their biggest weakness when it comes to eating healthy. While it's totally okay to enjoy them in moderation, there are also easy substitutions you can make at home! As long as you have a working oven, you can slice up some potatoes, season them however you enjoy your fries and pop them in the oven until they are crispy like french fries. Serve with a side of your favorite dipping sauce and they can be just as good without being fried! They also make a great side dish for any dinner. Paige Holloway / Daily Nexus Pizza: Another savory craving you may find yourself missing when you try to eat healthy is pizza. Luckily enough, health stores like Trader Joe's now offer frozen pizza crusts that are great alternatives to normal pizza. My favorite is their cauliflower crust, but they also provide one made from kale. This option of make-at-home pizza also allows you to customize what sauce, toppings and cheese you pick in order to be conscious of what ingredients go into it.† Eating healthy doesn't mean you have to give up all foods that are deemed unhealthy.ù As long as you are practicing moderation, you can keep some of these favorites in your life. Today there are also so many readily available healthy alternatives that we don't need to feel like we are restricting ourselves. Hopefully, some of these items will help you become more mindful of ingredients and sustain your healthy habits!

Try to take advantage of the market's student discount one last time and get a taste of their wild scallops, oysters and lobster.

on-the-menu,Korean Beef Bulgogi Nachos,28-Jun-20,10:14 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/95002/,"I love making Korean ground beef bulgogi rice bowls and I wanted to upgrade the dish a bit more by making it into a fun fusion snack. By replacing the rice with nachos and adding some kimchi and cheese, I ended up making a delicious midday or midnight snack. These nachos are the perfect snack to grab while watching a movie or just because of how affordable and easy they are to make.†† Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: It was my first time making these nachos and they turned out delicious! I'd say that they taste even better than the beef bulgogi rice bowls I always eat because of the added flavor of the kimchi and because nachos are such a fun food to eat. I'll definitely be making this again and trying it with different carbs, such as fries or tater tots.

I would always order a galette-style pastry at coffee shops, but now I have one of the easiest recipes for a delicious apple-strawberry puff pastry tart that all of us can make at home! This is perfect for someone who is new to baking and it requires very few, mostly fruit, ingredients so it's a little lighter on the stomach.

on-the-menu,Home-made Lobster Rolls,14-Jul-20,2:16 PM,['Winnie Lam'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-14/home-made-lobster-rolls/,"Being surrounded by the ocean at UC Santa Barbara always makes me crave seafood. However, having an appetite for things like sashimi, oysters and shellfish isn't always the best for my wallet. I figured I could easily create a less expensive, homemade seafood alternative at home. After waiting for sales at the grocery store and substituting some ingredients, I was able to make lobster rolls! I checked online for sales on lobster tails and I got four lobster tails for around $20, which was definitely a steal. I also substituted New England-style hot dog buns for three Hawaiian sweet rolls, which worked out perfectly because the bread was pillowy-soft and the sweetness complemented the lobster really nicely. This recipe isn't like the conventional Maine-style or Connecticut-style lobster rolls, but they still turned out great. Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients (for 2 servings): Directions:† Before making this recipe, I considered serving the lobster rolls with a side of garlic noodles, but I became lazy and didn't end up making them. However, the lobster rolls were surprisingly very filling so this recipe could be served with or without carbs î it's totally up to you. I would highly recommend making this recipe because buying all four of the lobster tails cost me less than if I had purchased a single lobster roll from a restaurant, and they came out delicious!

on-the-menu,Finding the Perfect Plant-Based Protein,23-Jul-20,11:59 PM,['Paige Holloway'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-23/finding-the-perfect-plant-based-protein/,"If you've ever openly talked about being vegetarian, vegan or plant-based, you've probably been asked the question: How do you get enough protein?ù This question, almost always, is silly to me considering how many foods besides meat contain proteins. It's just important to be knowledgeable about protein sources and protein intake when choosing to go plant-based. Here are some of the many ways you can still get in a fair amount of protein without eating meat! Photo courtesy of Pikist.com One of the most popular alternative protein sources is soy. Soy products are great because they can be used in a vast variety of cuisines, just like meat, and there are many options to choose from. Tofu is one of its most well-like forms due to its versatility and can be used in scrambles, rice bowls, soups, smoothies and more! However, many people do not enjoy the texture of tofu, so tempeh may be a better option. Like tofu, tempeh is a soy product but it is less processed because the soybeans have not been broken down. Personally, I prefer tempeh so much more because it is dense and can quickly absorb whatever flavor you choose to season it with. My favorite use of tempeh is for teriyaki rice bowls or even as salad toppers. Additionally, soy protein powders are very popular and are a fantastic way to sneak in some extra protein into smoothies. Moreover, beans are an excellent protein option with lots of versatility. My personal favorite is garbanzo beans because they go with so many different food combinations and have a great taste. Whether you choose to roast them in the oven to make them crunchy, blend them to make homemade hummus or just throw them on top of a salad, they can completely spice up a meal. Black, pinto and kidney beans are also all great sources of protein that can be cooked in a variety of ways. A useful tip for anyone plant-based is to cook beans in bulk and then store the leftovers in the fridge so you always have a tasty protein source on hand! Another noteworthy protein source is lentils. They are fairly easy to cook on the stovetop and make a great cooked addition to any meal. Some of lentils' most popular uses are in soups, hot sandwiches and veggie burgers. In fact, many grocery stores now even carry lentil pasta for a healthier and more protein-filled pasta dish. Beyond these main protein staples, there also tons of foods that you may not know contain a good amount of protein. This includes almonds, pumpkin seeds, peas, quinoa, artichokes, asparagus, eggs and broccoli. Deciding to cut out meat doesn't mean you'll be in a protein deficit. There are so many ways to maintain your nutrition as well as keep your meals interesting and balanced!

Banana bread is a terrific option because you can use any bananas that you forgot to eat and have now become way too ripe, plus it requires minimal ingredients and effort. I didn't have a loaf pan to bake bread, so I made banana muffins instead and added in some crushed walnuts to add a little crunch! Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus Directions: Winnie Lam / Daily Nexus I've used this muffin recipe three times since quarantine started, and it hasn't failed me.

on-the-menu,A Delicious Denver Food Guide,6-Aug-20,1:22 PM,['Sonya Raytburg'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-06/delicious-denver-food-guide/,"After a few months of home-cooked meals, which were definitely missed before quarantine began, the craving for takeout slowly started to creep in. As restaurants began to reopen with safety precautions, my family felt safer going to pick up takeout or to dine-in where there was outdoor seating. If you live in Denver or are planning a road trip there sometime after COVID-19, this is a list of some of our favorite places which we discovered! In case that you plan on trying some of these restaurants in the near future, the safety precautions will be mentioned for each place and can be found in more detail on their websites.† Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Uncle† Wow! Growing up in NYC, I loved going to all the new ramen spots and ramen quickly became one of my favorite foods. Uncle was absolutely worth the hype and my craving for good ramen was totally satisfied. They have more traditional Japanese options and then more funky ones that are unique to them. We had the pork belly and crispy Chinese eggplant buns, which were both super flavorful but stood out because the buns themselves were perfect. The rest of my family had the spicy chicken ramen, which Uncle is most well known for, and it was definitely a hit, especially if you love spicy food. I went the more traditional route with the Tokyo Shoyu ramen and it didn't feel heavy, the broth wasn't too salty and it was simply delicious. If you haven't had ramen in a while, this place will not disappoint.† * As of Aug. 2, they are offering dine-in with outdoor seating, takeout and no-contact delivery.† Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Stowaway Kitchen Located in the River North Art District area, this restaurant makes food that definitely adds to the aesthetic. This place is the PERFECT brunch spot. They have breakfast, lunch and options in between î hence why they call their menu Brunchy.ù I had the apricot and saffron sourdough waffle, which had the most delicious saffron custard cream with seared apricots and was topped with toasted pistachios. I am not usually a waffle person but this was honestly out of this world; even the description makes it sound stunning. I tasted what the rest of my family got, which was more savory and leaning towards lunch and I would suggest these plates too. The Colorful Colorado, which is a salt-and-vinegar hash with ham, tons of veggies and topped with a poached egg, was so flavorful and was the perfect combination of savory breakfast ingredients. Another standout was the Japanese asa-gohanm, which is grilled salmon with avocado, carrot and ginger slaw, poached egg and rice. It was an interesting way to put an American twist on a Japanese-style breakfast. I would also recommend trying anything from their Baked Todayù section î we had the best blueberry muffin I have ever had î and getting a cup of their awesome coffee.† *As of Aug. 2, they are open for dine-in with outdoor seating by reservation only, pickup and delivery.† † Onefold This breakfast/lunch spot is crazy! This apparently hole-in-the-wallù place has tons of super cool options, many of which include something being cooked in duck fat. The two standout options that we got were the breakfast tacos and the congee. The tacos had homemade tortillas, scrambled eggs, crispy hashbrowns, grilled mozzarella cheese and a choice of meat, with housemade green or red salsa on the side. This was definitely stepping out of my comfort zone since I don't usually go for breakfast tacos but these were special and just super tasty in every way! The congee was probably one of my favorite and more unique dishes that I tried on this trip. The congee is rice porridge cooked in chicken stock, duck confit, poached egg, green onions, tamari soy sauce, salted ginger and chili oil. I was honestly a little nervous to try it because the description sounded super intense but it wasn't super heavy and all the flavors blended so well together in an almost subtle way that made it so easy to just keep wanting more! They have less intense food options as well, but if you come here, I think these two dishes are a must. * As of Aug. 2, they are only doing curbside pickup and no-contact delivery. Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Safta This was our first dinner in Denver and it is definitely my favorite! It is a modern Israeli restaurant opened by an award-winning Israeli chef, Alon Shaya. This place has so many delicious dips and amazing Mediterranean flavors. They had several types of hummus but we chose the tahini and wood-roasted mushroom, served with lots of hot off-the-press pita. I love hummus and these were so good that I continued eating whatever was left even after we finished our mains. For the salatim, we had the baba ganoush (charred eggplant, lemon and sour cream), muhammara (hazelnuts, cilantro and chili oil) and the lutenitsa (roasted eggplant, peppers, tomato and garlic), which was the closest to what I ate in Israel. Needless to say, you can't go wrong with any of these and once you start eating them, you can't stop dipping. For the mains, we all shared the falafel, cheese bourekas and the half harissa chicken. The falafels were not even remotely dry and had so much flavor, the cheese bourekas were a perfect combination of sweet and savory with the perfect crunch, the half harissa chicken was so juicy and the stunning harissa paste that didn't overpower the chicken. If you come here I would definitely recommend sharing everything so that you can try so much more. Oh, and if you want a non-alcoholic drink, I would try the Moroccan mint tea press! *As of Aug. 2, they are offering dine-in, takeout, and delivery.† † Cart-Driver We wanted to bring it back to basics after our major breakfast at Onefold so we came here for some pizza. Again, growing up in NYC made me super picky about pizza but this place really nailed it. We got two super delicious appetizers î the chicken liver mousse, which they actually make in house, and the Panzanella salad. The main stars were the pizzas, of course. We got the Daisy, which is your basic margarita, but all of the ingredients tasted super fresh and the crust was perfect. We also had the Market Pizza, which is basil-almond pesto with farm tomatoes, mozzarella and balsamic reduction, and finally, the mortadella, which had pistachio, ricotta, mortadella, balsamic and arugula. The pizza toppings speak for themselves and the crust was cooked perfectly, so if you're in a pizza mood, you should definitely check them out!† *As of Aug. 2, they are open for in-house dining with both indoor and outdoor seating as well as pickup.† † Some Bonus Recs We gathered a list of places to go from local Denverites, but we didn't have time to go everywhere so I would like to pass on the list just in case the restaurants I mentioned are not enough.† Comments are closed.

This watermelon cooler recipe is not only quick and easy to make, but it's an absolutely perfect way to cool off in this hot weather. Watermelon is my favorite summer fruit, and I was so excited when I found this recipe. I've always loved refreshing myself with some blended watermelon, but this special twist makes the drink even better.† Michelle Wan / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: The amount of lemon juice needed for this recipe depends on the size of the watermelon. In my opinion, a large watermelon would require about four lemons while a medium-sized one requires about two lemons. However, it would be in your best interest to add two lemons first and then add more if needed. I didn't add any sugar because the watermelon was already sweet enough, but feel free to add sugar after the first taste if you are craving something sweeter. The seltzer water is a great addition to the recipe, but if you don't have any at home, it's not a problem; it still tastes amazing without it!† As you can see, this recipe is very flexible and you can't go wrong with it.

Or looking to satisfy your s'mores cravings? Now you can enjoy these summer classics without getting a campfire ready. These s'mores crescent rolls are quick and easy to make, and they can be enjoyed as a snack, a dessert or even for breakfast. They work great as a finger food, and anyone with a sweet tooth will love these warm, fluffy treats. Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Directions: Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus This recipe is very useful for using up leftover dough because it's difficult to store once the tube pops open, and s'mores crescent rolls are much more exciting than plain ones. Using Nutella makes for a less dry and more sweet pastry, but if you're looking for the classic s'mores flavor using the mini chocolate chips is best. The mini marshmallows melt too fast and the puff pastry absorbs them during the bake; so another good idea would be to add marshmallow fluff inside the rolls, or use marshmallow fluff as a dip. This is also a fun recipe to make with friends or little ones, since its measurements don't need to be precise and the instructions are straightforward.

Relatively new to State Street, Embermill is a Caribbean-Creole restaurant run by head chef Harold Welch, who moved to Santa Barbara from his home country of Barbados 25 years ago. As I approached Embermill, I was met with an incredible smell: their wood-burning oven. It almost sent me levitating to their door, like a cartoon character floating after the scent of a freshly baked pie. Many of their dishes, including their jerk chicken, are cooked in this oven, imparting them with deliciously unique flavor. The restaurant has a beautiful patio area for in-house dining, but also offers takeout if you're not comfortable eating at the restaurant.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Embermill's atmosphere is incredibly welcoming. The servers are friendly, the smell of the wood-burning oven is cozy and the plant life surrounding the patio gives it a serene vibe. I could sit and hang out with friends, or read a book there (exactly what our hostess was doing before we arrived, coincidentally) forever. I felt even more welcome once I received my menu. I can't eat gluten or dairy (rough, I know) so when I saw that Embermill puts gluten-free, dairy-free and vegan markers next to their dishes on the menu, I was immediately at ease. Not only did I know exactly what I could eat, but the vast majority of their menu was both gluten and dairy-free, giving me an overwhelming amount of options.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus My friends and I started out our meal with their pan-seared brussel sprouts, the fried plantains with a guava balsamic reduction and the goat cheese bruschetta. The brussel sprouts were some of the best I'd ever had. They were amazingly crispy and perfectly seasoned with a Creole spice mix. The fried plantains were great as well. The crisp outside and plush inside made for a great textural experience. The guava balsamic reduction tasted fantastic, and while I wanted a little more guava flavor, it's acidic punch still complemented the sweetness of the plantains beautifully. While I couldn't taste the bruschetta myself, it elicited myriad wowsù and mmmsù from my friends, who all lamented the fact that I couldn't experience it with them.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Up next, our main dishes: curried goat, stewed oxtail and their jerk chicken. I was thrilled; I'd never tried goat or oxtail before and was ready for something new. Safe to say, they didn't disappoint. The curried goat was fantastic. Fall-off-the-bone tender goat meat, with crisp vegetables in a powerful curry broth; it was an explosion of flavor. However, the oxtail was the highlight of the meal for me. Similar to the curry, it featured beautifully tender meat in a delicious broth, this time with a powerful red wine flavor reminiscent of French cuisine. I could have licked the bowl clean, and probably would have if they hadn't brought out a side of rice and beans to soak up the broth. The jerk chicken was also explosively flavorful. I was amazed at how much flavor the wood-burning oven had imparted on the meat. It was a unique flavor I'd never tried before and elevated the dish over any jerk chicken I'd had in the past.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus If you're like me, mealtime is one of the best parts of the day in quarantine. Trying out a new, exciting restaurant can make that best part even better. Embermill is a fantastic option for takeout, or, if you're comfortable with it, dining in. Their food is adventurous but doesn't sacrifice any quality by trying to cook too far outside the box. Support a Black-owned business and try out Embermill!† Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,Three Mexican Antojitos Year-Round,1-Oct-20,12:29 PM,['Liliana Linan'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-01/three-mexican-antojitos-year-round/,"In Mexico, snacks are called antojitos,ù which comes from the word antojoù that means craving,ù so when Mexicans eat snacks they are eating little cravings.ù These three street foods are commonly associated with summer, as strawberries, corn and cool drinks typically are. Yet, people in both Mexico and Mexican-American communities in the United States enjoy these delicacies year-round.† Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Fresas con Crema† This is the perfect summer snack or dessert because it doesn't require any baking. Fresas con crema, or strawberries with cream, is a popular street food in Mexico that can also be found in the country's ice cream shops and at parties. In the U.S., this treat is rare but is typically sold in Mexican ice cream shops and next to LA taco stands. The ingredients and the process are extremely simple, and this is a very relaxed recipe because there are no exact measurements; every ingredient can be altered according to taste! Fresas con crema is creamy yet refreshing and makes you feel healthy for eating dessert!† Ingredients: Directions: Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Horchata This is a traditional and beloved Mexican agua fresca. The literal meaning of agua fresca† is fresh waterù and these drinks are typically made out of fruit, flowers or seeds. Horchata is one of the most popular agua frescas, and it is made out of rice and cinnamon. Horchataù comes from the Latin word hordeata,ù which in turn comes from hordeum,ù meaning barley, since Mediterranean cultures would make drinks out of grains. Another variety found in Valencia, Nigeria, Mali and Spain uses tiger nuts. In Mexico, horchata is sold by street vendors, ice cream shops and restaurants. In LA, there are street vendors who sell aguas frescas, but in the U.S., the only places that sell horchata are restaurants, taco stands and some Mexican cafes which have taken a twist on horchata to create horchata frappes or lattes. Classic Mexican horchata is meant to be gritty, and this recipe creates more of a concentrate. Make sure to fill each cup with a lot of ice so you don't have to worry about watering it down, and get ready to cool down with this milky and delicious drink.† Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Elotes and Esquietes Maize, or corn, has been a crucial ingredient in Mexico since the origin of its Indigenous tribes and is used for some of the most important Mexican staples like tortillas, tamales, champurrado and elotes or esquites. Esquites are basically elotes on the go, and elotes are made when a whole corn is cooked and then covered in mayonnaise or cream, cheese, butter and chile. Choosing between an elote or an esquite is like choosing to eat ice cream in a cone or in a cup. I prefer esquites because they are easier to eat and I enjoy mixing all the ingredients together. In Mexico, these are sold by street vendors and in the U.S., eloteros or Mexican ice cream shops sell them. The corn can be boiled or grilled, and though there are many substitutions for the ingredients and modern creative toppings, the ones below create the most flavorful combination. This recipe is very inexpensive and easy, and none of the amounts have to be exact. Elotes or esquites are savory snacks that are juicy, spicy and filling, plus the crushed hot cheetos add an extra layer of crunch and flavor.† Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: Comments are closed.

I think this recipe has the potential to convert the masses to Team Celery. Perfect for a weeknight meal, this quick and healthy stir fry can be whipped up in 30 minutes and tastes amazing. This stir fry can also easily be made vegan by using tofu instead of chicken, and gluten-free by using tamari instead of soy sauce. Either way, I consider the celery to be the star of the dish; it adds amazing crunch and its freshness cuts through the acidity of the sauce perfectly.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Ingredients (Sauce): Ingredients (Main): Directions: This is a perfect dish for a weeknight, with bold flavors and fantastic textures.

on-the-menu,The Quest for the Perfect Peanut Butter Cup,6-Oct-20,12:39 AM,['Charlotte Glass'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-06/the-quest-for-the-perfect-peanut-butter-cup/,"In recent years, a vast array of competitors have sought to perfect one of America's favorite chocolatey treats: peanut butter cups. Companies have taken your traditional REESE'S Peanut Butter Cups and experimented with different chocolates, sizes, shapes and recipes. In fact, you may even find yourself a bit overwhelmed when deciding what peanut butter delight to indulge in. Don't worry î On The Menu has you covered. Here's a look at the five most popular peanut butter cups currently on the market.† Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus REESE'S Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups ì 3/10 Of course, I started with the original REESE'S Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups. The density of the cup made it quite fun to eat as if you were sinking your teeth into a cloud of peanut butter. Despite an enjoyable first bite, the peanut butter became grainy upon chewing î borderline sandy, actually. It also immediately overpowered the chocolate coating, leaving a lingering taste of sub-par peanut butter. Once notes of chocolate finally revealed themselves, however, I wished they hadn't. The chocolate tasted of pure sugar. It almost felt as though REESE'S had used the cast-off chocolate from a HERSHEY'S factory and covered it up with a thick peanut butter filling. While a perfectly fine treat at a movie theater or around Halloween time, this certainly wouldn't be my first choice if craving a peanut butter cup. As a whole, the REESE'S was much too sweet in my opinion, and lacked the sweet-salty dichotomy that is the brilliance of a chocolate peanut butter cup's design. Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus Justin's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups ì 8/10 Justin's has recently grown popular for its delicious selection of organic nut butters and peanut butter cups. In 2004, Justin Gold, a cyclist from Colorado, started developing homemade nut butters packed with protein to fuel his bike rides and eventually expanded his hobby into an enterprise. The company's signature focus on natural ingredients made them highly appealing to farmer's markets and health food stores such as Whole Foods Market. For me, Justin's natural approach proved successful as high-quality ingredients clearly shined through the peanut butter cup. Unlike many other brands (especially REESE'S), Justin's was infinitely less artificial. It actually possessed flavor and texture beyond cane sugar. What struck me most about this cup was a harmonious combination of chocolate and peanut butter. The dark chocolate tasted rich yet not overpowering, in effect complementing the saltiness of the peanut butter instead of challenging it with too much sweetness. While the cup was a bit thin and definitely could benefit from a bit more peanut butter, the structure still contributed to its goodness. The gooey peanut butter provided the perfect accompaniment to a crisp chocolate shell. Moving forward, I would always recommend a peanut butter cup paired with dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate. Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus Perfect Snacks Dark Chocolate with Sea Salt Refrigerated Peanut Butter Cups ì 2/10 Perfect Snacks Dark Chocolate with Sea Salt Refrigerated Peanut Butter Cups bring healthy to the next level. The company offers a variety of bars, protein bites and peanut butter cups loaded with whole ingredients and superfoods. In fact, all Perfect Snacks must be stored in the refrigerator because they contain no artificial preservatives and are sweetened primarily with honey. While I have great respect for the mission of the company and the creativeness of its designs, I would by no means categorize this peanut butter cup as a treat. It really is more like a protein bar in the shape of a peanut butter cup. Instead of savoring a creamy filling, I was met with a powdery interior that hardly tasted of peanut butter. To make matters worse, the chocolate was also underwhelming. It barely withstood the persistent flavor of protein concentrate. Another way in which this cup varied from a more traditional offering was its shape. The Perfect Snacks cup resembled a dome lacking the usual ridges and curvature. This structure did not at all compromise the cup, but its poor taste alone managed to do so. I again reiterate that this is not a treat. While certainly a lighter option, I would stick to real peanut butter cups.† Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus REESE'S THiNS Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups ì 5/10 As more and more competitors have sprung up in recent years, REESE'S has evolved to meet the times. The company now offers a wide selection of chocolates î from white chocolate to dark chocolate î and shapes in addition to its original peanut butter cup. I tried their THiNS Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups and found myself pleasantly surprised. While the peanut butter still maintained the shortcomings of the original REESE'S, the quality of the chocolate was much improved. The richness of a dark chocolate coating better matched the peanut butter and left an enjoyable chocolatey aftertaste. However, I do believe even darker chocolate would enhance the cup's flavor. As for its structure, the REESE'S THiN provided a decent crunch yet also an opportunity to skimp a bit on the peanut butter. I did miss the thick, buttery interior of an original REESE'S. In many ways, this cup resembled a rip-off of Justin's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups with lower-quality ingredients. All in all, though, this REESE'S most definitely represented a step up from the original.† Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups ì 10/10 Trader Joe's has done it yet again. Its store-brand Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups were hands down the best of all those I tried. Unlike the other cups, these were mini. The smaller shape allowed for a thicker chocolate coating and concentrated the peanut butter into delightful pockets of creamy goodness. This structure resulted in a compact, powerful bite that delivered on all fronts of taste, balance and texture. What really sold me on these, though, was the chocolate. Smooth and flavorful, the chocolate supplied the perfect level of sweetness to complement the saltiness of the peanut butter. The two both played off and morphed into each other seamlessly î truly a match made in heaven. This is the kind of peanut butter cup that I would actively seek out, even if the nearest Trader Joe's was miles away.†††† Hopefully these thoughts gave you greater insight into the peanut butter cups currently on the shelves of your local grocery and convenience stores. Next time you choose one of these delights, you will know exactly what to expect. Then again, all palates are unique. You may just need to have a taste test of your own.

Well, this recipe is perfect for you. So simple it's practically foolproof, this easy creme caramel is a delicious custard that you can easily make on the weekend, leave in the fridge and eat throughout the week. However, it's so tasty that it might be gone before the week is out. Christine Tu / Daily Nexus Ingredients (for 8 servings): Christine Tu / Daily Nexus Directions: Christine Tu / Daily Nexus A fun thing about this recipe is that you can totally jazz it up with a variety of toppings. Replace the maple syrup with berries and honey for a healthy (or relatively healthier) take on this recipe, or you can instead add whipped cream for a fun twist. My personal favorite is to replace the vanilla extract with a tablespoon of instant coffee and then drizzle the finished custard with melted dark chocolate. By changing up the toppings, this dish can be used for all occasions and you really can't go wrong with any of them!†

Somebody Feed Philù has become one of my favorite shows on Netflix so I had to share it with all of you! I binged the show with my family during quarantine because we had a major travel bug and this show combined our two favorite things: travel and food. Phil Rosenthal, also the creator of Everybody Loves Raymond,ù is the host of the show traveling to different countries to try the local cuisine and experience the culture. One of the main things that make this show so great, besides the delicious food and cinematic shots of all of the beautiful spots, is Phil himself. He's super fun with all of his corny jokes and lighthearted personality. It is truly an enjoyable show and will definitely make your mouth water just a little bit. I'm going to talk about a few of my favorite dishes from some of the episodes, each episode takes place in a different country, so you can get a taste for the show! Lulu Octeau / Daily Nexus Bangkok, Thailand From trying a 25-course tasting menu to touring Bangkok's greatest markets, a dish that stood out to me was from a restaurant on the side of the road in downtown that is known for the dish, khao soi. Khao soi has egg noodles, fresh-locally sourced meat and chilies in a broth that is simmered for 24 hours which turns into a creamy coconut curry that is topped with crispy rice noodles. This dish looked amazing in the show and watching everything be handmade with a local's touch definitely put khao soi on my list of foods to try! Lulu Octeau / Daily Nexus Tel Aviv, Israel I had a hard time choosing which dish to write about, but ultimately I had to go with the classic shakshuka! Shakshuka is a tomato stew with peppers and different spices that is topped with eggs right before it's finished cooking. Trust me, shakshuka is such a tasty breakfast dish. In this episode, Phil gets shakshuka from someone known as Dr. Shakshuka and a man I would do anything to try what this doctor prescribes. Phil tried his shakshuka with spicy sausage and had some beautiful bread to dip as well, so hopefully one day we can all pay a visit to Dr. Shakshuka and have the same stunning brunch! Mikah Nelson / Daily Nexus Lisbon, Portugal At the famous Time Out Market in Lisbon, Phil tried the delicious national Portuguese dessert called pastel de nata! Manteigaria is one of the most famous pastry shops that make this delicious egg tart pastry so Phil definitely made the right stop to try his first one! A pastel de nata is even tastier when topped with cinnamon and sugar which can definitely be confirmed by Phil's extremely satisfied facial expression one bite in. I have to say I have tried this pastel de nata from the same bakery and I concur that this pastry is heavenly. Kiyomi Morrison / Daily Nexus Copenhagen, Denmark I've always wanted to go to Copenhagen, so I was really excited to see where Phil went in this episode! I'm surprised to say that I've never wanted a hot dog more in my life. Phil tried such delicious looking sausages dressed with even more yummy toppings. The first hot dog he tried was topped with mustard, a Danish sauce called r√©moulade (which is similar to mayonnaise but with onions and pickles in it), ketchup, fried onions, fresh onions and finally some pickles. Sounds like a lot, but these are actually the traditional Danish toppings and boy did this classic look like the most delicious gourmet hot dog that I've ever seen! Phil also tried some other types of sausages like pork with wild garlic in it, chicken, spicy beef sausage which can also be topped with spicy ketchup, pork with cheese in it and even a vegetarian one! Who knew hot dogs could be elevated so much?† Kiyomi Morrison / Daily Nexus Marrakesh, Morocco The culture is so rich in this episode and Phil even got to eat dinner with a local family that made an amazing couscous dish! The dish that stood out the most to me was definitely the lamb he tried at a restaurant called Chez Lamine. The lamb is baked under the ground in an alley in the medina! That sounds pretty crazy, but watching the process in the episode showcased how insanely good it is. The meat comes out really moist and it is completely natural because the chef who has been preparing lamb this way for 49 years doesn't add anything to it, no spices, nothing! If you do want to add something, the lamb is served with a side of harissa but Phil said the meat has so much flavor that you barely need it. This is definitely another dish to add to my list! I hope you're a little hungry now because I certainly am. This show is bound to put you in a good mood, inspire you to visit the places Phil traveled, or even cook something new at home! In each episode, Phil meets friends, immerses himself in each country's culture and talks to his family about his adventures which is such a good reminder that food and travel can be such an amazing experience to share with others. He has so many great laughs that you feel a part of the entire time! On a more food-related note, it is super cool to see the way other countries and cultures utilize their local ingredients to make their national dishes in addition to their innovative ones in some of the world's top restaurants. Needless to say, I wish I had a show called Somebody Feed Sonyaù but I have been living vicariously through Phil who is a top-notch guy with great food and travel recommendations!

At the beginning of October, Rockfire Grill was transformed into Rockfire Waffle Shack, the pseudonym for their weekend-only breakfast shop. Rockfire Waffle Shack started out with a bang and released a full breakfast menu of decently priced items consisting of waffles, omelettes, coffee, mimosas and Shack Specials like beignets and huevos rancheros.†  I had the pleasure of visiting Rockfire Waffle Shack on its second Friday ever opened, where I tried the banana Nutella waffle and the loaded breakfast fries. On the Rockfire breakfast menu, the waffle is described as: two of our original golden brown waffles topped with Nutella, banana slices, whipped butter, and powdered sugar;ù while the loaded breakfast fries are: seasoned fries served with melted mozzarella and cheddar cheese, bacon, [a] fried egg, spicy sauce, and cilantro.ù† In this video, I try these two items and give viewers a visual look into I.V.'s new breakfast spot. My final reviews were: an 8.5/10 for the loaded breakfast fries and an 8/10 for the banana Nutella waffle. The fries were very well seasoned and crunchy, but the bacon was too flimsy. The egg was a delicious addition but was the only real breakfast aspect of the fries. I enjoyed the spicy mayo but it left me craving a sauce with more of a kick; especially since the hot sauce on the side was watery and flavorless.† It was pleasing to have two, thin waffles stacked on top of each other, but they were close to being soggy, and with the golden brownù description I expected the restaurant waffles to have a crunchy outside with a warm, soft inside, but that lacked. The waffles themselves had a great cinnamon-vanilla flavor that tastes homemade, and of course, the classic banana-Nutella combination can never disappoint. The whipped butter ball was so large that I at first thought it was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and was disgusted when I took a big bite of it with the waffle. Despite my fears, the addition of the side syrup did not create an overly sweet meal, and it tied all the comforting flavors together.† Overall, I did enjoy Rockfire's new breakfast menu, especially since I.V. was lacking in breakfast options. If you're looking for something new to try, visit Rockfire Waffle Shack; only open Friday-Sunday from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.

on-the-menu,S.Y. Kitchen: A Cozy Italian Restaurant,20-Oct-20,7:06 AM,['Sonya Raytburg'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-20/s-y-kitchen-a-cozy-italian-restaurant/,"S.Y. Kitchen is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara County. It is in the Santa Ynez Valley, which is about a 40-minute drive from downtown Santa Barbara, so it also provides a nice way to go somewhere scenic for the day and have one of the greatest meals in the area! It is a cozy, modern Italian restaurant and I guarantee you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, both for lunch and dinner. I'm excited to tell you about my most recent visit to S.Y. Kitchen, where they use fresh, local ingredients! Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus Craving delicious food and a nice day trip, my mom and I decided to go to S.Y. Kitchen for lunch. It has been at the top of my list of restaurants to revisit for a whole year ever since my first dinner there with my family. I can tell you for sure that my expectations were totally met and even exceeded. We were seated at a super comfortable booth outside and the table was at the perfect height to hide the food baby I got by the end of the lunch! We decided to have one of the entrees as an appetizer because ¶ well, you'll understand the second you hear the description. The entree-made-appetizer was the T-Bone Truffle Sliders î which came with truffle cheese, caramelized shallots, parmigiano crisp and potatoes î and it was absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious, so I highly recommend it. To be more descriptive, the sliders were so juicy, the caramelized shallots added the perfect amount of sweetness, the subtle taste of truffle added some earthy flavor and it was all finished with the crunch of the parmigiano crisp which made for the most satisfying bite.† Then, both my mom and I couldn't resist ordering the same handmade pasta even though we usually always try to get different dishes so that we can try more food. We each ordered our own wild mushroom pappardelle, which has fresh wild mushrooms, thyme and parmigiano. It is truly perfect creamy goodness and has a generous amount of fresh mushrooms, which you don't see at restaurants too often. This mushroom pasta is officially on my list of food cravings! You would think that after the sliders and the mushroom pasta that we would pass on dessert, but when you're at S.Y. Kitchen, you go big or go home! We had no idea which dessert to try, so we asked the waiter for his recommendations and he said he loves the tiramisu, which is such a classic, so we ordered it right away and were not disappointed. I usually prefer the ladyfinger/coffee part of tiramisu more than the cream but I have to say, with this one, I couldn't stop eating the cream because it had a thicker consistency and wasn't too sweet. This tiramisu had the perfect proportion of cocoa powder, coffee and cream which is usually so hard to find!† This review may make it seem like I am just professing my love for this restaurant, but I can't recommend it enough! I've had such wonderful memories with my family at this restaurant eating the most delicious food with a great ambiance and the kindest waiters. If you're looking for a little adventure, I really recommend taking the scenic drive to S.Y. Kitchen for a superb meal. Afterward, if you're of age, I also suggest that you check out all the nearby wineries or even drive through Los Olivos and take a little stroll!†

on-the-menu,Caj√©'s Pumpkin Spice Latte: A Local Take on a Seasonal Delight,27-Oct-20,12:52 AM,['Charlotte Glass'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-27/cajes-pumpkin-spice-latte-a-local-take-on-a-seasonal-delight/,"While in Isla Vista the leaves remain unchanged and the weather still lingers around 80 degrees, fall has begun. One of the only telling signs of a season change in the area is the arrival of the pumpkin spice latte. For those looking to indulge in some fall festivities but who are sick and tired of the notorious Starbucks pumpkin spice latte, Caj√© offers a more mature adaptation of the drink. Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus First and foremost, I recommend you get this latte hot î ordering an iced pumpkin spice latte is abominable, in all honesty. The temperature of this particular beverage almost entirely shapes the drinker's experience with it. What more says crisp fall air than a steaming cup of coffee? As I sat outside the cafe with my cup on an early, foggy morning, I felt the first tinglings of fall.† What struck me most about the latte was its spiciness. Cinnamon and nutmeg delivered a comforting yet powerful flavor. As for the pumpkin component of the latte, I must admit that it was lacking. The spices î which, don't get me wrong, I most definitely enjoyed î overpowered the faintest hint of pumpkin that required thorough concentration to pick up on. A more accurate name for the latte would probably be Autumn Spiced Latteù or anything emphasizing spice rather than pumpkin. All in all, though, I would certainly order this drink again. No flavored syrups or overload of sweetener masked the taste of the coffee, keeping in tune with Caj√©'s laid-back cadence. The lack of additional artificial flavoring also allows the quality of their coffee to shine. On that note, I would say this is definitely a drink for seasoned coffee drinkers. If you wouldn't normally order a coffee, this isn't the drink for you. Those who do appreciate high-quality roasting, though, would be quite pleased with their order.† So, if you're looking for a seamless transition into autumn, look no further than Caj√©'s pumpkin spice latte. To maximize your experience, I recommend either a cinnamon raisin or blueberry bagel for pairing. Happy harvesting!

The weather in California has finally cooled to 78 degrees. Festive decorations adorn houses, as they will stay that way for the next six months. Holiday movies are scheduled for their annual reruns. Beverage stores are full of homey spices and aromas. Thematic foods and desserts decorate our explore pages. And we just want to be part of the fun! Take a load off from midterms with these stress-free and timely treats. Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Small Spooky Spider Pizzas [insert picture] If you are looking to get some real food before jumping to the sweets category, try these mini spider pizzas. They are both fresh-tasting and well-fitting for the season î a guaranteed win! And if you need to skip the homemade components, frozen or pre-made pizzas will achieve the same goal. Similarly, canned pizza sauce can replace the sauce recipe below. Use whatever you have on hand, and have fun!† Ingredients (Homemade Pizza Sauce): Ingredients (Toppings and Dough): Directions (for the sauce): Instructions (for the pizzas): Make sure to give your friends or housemates a forewarning before serving these. From far away, the olives really do look like spiders. Making these pizzas from scratch is not only rewarding but also makes for a healthier meal. Which means more room for the sweets!† † Spooky Brownie Ideas You may think you have tried all combinations of the brownie î more chocolate chips, peanut butter, Oreo, caramel and more chocolate chips. It is a blank canvas for so much more. Take a batch of homemade brownies or a box of brownie mix to new heights this Halloween with these pumpkin patch and cobweb designs. First, you'll need your brownie base: thin and baked 9-by-13-inch shape. Though a box mix provides efficiency and ease, homemade brownies are just as simple. Not to mention, you can substitute in more healthy options such as whole wheat flour or reducing sugar. In a brownie as decadent as this, you won't be able to spot the difference.† Ingredients:† Directions: Remove your brownies from the oven and patiently allow them to come to room temperature before touching them. For both the pumpkin patch and cobweb designs, it is recommended to cut the brownies into squares before decorating. If you have a wire rack, place the brownies on top and slide a plate underneath to catch any droppings.† Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Cobweb Brownies For these cobweb brownies, you'll need about a cup of marshmallows. Microwave them until they are gooey and melted. They will puff up and start to rise above the bowl at around 30 seconds. Using a fork, stir until smooth and let them cool slightly. Know that once you start stirring them, heat and air bubbles will escape and the marshmallow fluff will return to a reasonable-looking amount. Using two forks, stretch about a tablespoon of the melted marshmallow into a thin strand to drape over the brownies. The marshmallows are extremely sticky and will get everywhere. If you try to fix a mistake with your finger, it may be a few seconds before you can remove your fingers from the sticky mess.† Try to use a corner of a brownie as a starting place and string each marshmallow strand from that corner. Repeat to create a web-like pattern. For a little added fun, you can place some sprinkles or chocolate chips on top to make it look like your web has caught something. Be aware that actual non-food items may also get caught in the web. The marshmallows will stay sticky, so serve immediately. They can be stored for up to 2 days. Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Pumpkin Patch Brownies These pumpkin patch brownies allow for plenty of creative freedom. Some ideas are: For the most indulgent version of these brownies, start with chocolate frosting. Spread it across the brownies, then generously sprinkle Oreo crumbs on top. Once you have the earthy ground taken care of, cultivate your farm î spread out the pumpkins, some clustered, some solo. With green icing (or melted white chocolate combined with a few drops of green food coloring), connect the vines on each of the pumpkins, and watch the patch grow to life.† Further decorations with gummy worms, candy corn and various other candies are more than welcome. Serve immediately or store for up to 3-4 days. They always taste the best on the first day, so don't be afraid to share with housemates or friends and dig in!† Brag about your delightfully spooky creations by tagging @ucsbonthemenu on Instagram!

The tradition dates back to October 2016, when Bagel Cafe had a series of sales to celebrate its 25th anniversary here in I.V. Throughout the month of October, there were special deals on menu items, from bagels to coffee to melts, turning back the clock to a time when a 12-ounce cup of coffee only cost 95¢.† Rachel Dye / Daily Nexus This year, the sale was condensed into a week-long extravaganza, Oct. 12-16, with every day featuring a different section of the menu: bagels with cream cheese, eggles, coffee, lox bagels and, finally, melts. I caught the tail end of the sale, deciding to go get some fresh air as I walked from my apartment in I.V. to the classic cafe on Trigo Road, only two streets up from the beach. As usual, the cafe was busy with a line out the door, but everyone was mindful to stay six feet apart both in line and while waiting for their bagels. A bright, colorful sign announced the sale, attracting students and residents alike who were passing by on the street.† After waiting in line, I ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and lox, only $4.50 instead of the usual $8.63 it would be if you ordered online. The Bagel Cafe's close proximity to park picnic tables made it super easy for me to sit and enjoy my fresh, delicious bagel in the warm Santa Barbara early afternoon. While simple, the bagel was super high quality, toasted to perfection, with the sweet cream cheese and smoky salmon creating a lovely pallet of flavor. I saw others, friends and families alike, doing the same as me and enjoying the beautiful day with their delicious (and cheap!) breakfast.† Rachel Dye / Daily Nexus The next day I was in the mood for a cheesy, bready lunch, and once again I found myself at Bagel Cafe î this time for a Deluxe Melt for only $3.95 (vs. $7.77 at normal price), containing an everything bagel, sun-dried tomato cream cheese, tomato, onion, lemon pepper and melted cheddar cheese. The sharp cheddar contrasted perfectly with the fresh burst of tomato, the slightly peppery crunch of the onions and savory cream cheese; a treat anyone would enjoy. I went home satisfied and full of the energy desperately needed to finish up homework.† Bagel Cafe has kept up this anniversary sale to appreciate and celebrate the community here in I.V. where it has made its home for 29 years. It's a staple, ever-popular and ever delicious; a place where people have come to enjoy Santa Barbara in its finest form, with good people, good food and great weather. I definitely recommend I.V. Bagel Cafe not just during its 1991 sale, but year-round as well. Keep an eye on the Bagel Cafe's Facebook page for announcements and potential surprise sales, as well as next year's annual 1991 Sale.†

on-the-menu,The Quest for the Perfect Gluten-Free Nugget,7-Nov-20,7:38 AM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-07/the-quest-for-the-perfect-gluten-free-nugget/,"I love to cook, but especially with classes having started up again, sometimes I'm just too lazy to get in the kitchen. After a busy day, it's easier to throw a bunch of frozen chicken nuggets in the oven and have a meal ready after a few minutes of pacing around the kitchen than it is to plan, prep for and cook a whole meal. Luckily for us gluten-free folks, there's been an explosion in the GF chicken nugget market in recent years. So I, a martyr for my cause, took on the immense responsibility of stuffing myself full of different brands of GF nuggets to bring a ranking of the more readily available brands to the masses.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets Score: 7/10 For many, walking through the freezer aisle at Trader Joe's is like walking through a vast and wondrous Eden, surrounded by delicious frozen delicacies promising that, as long as you own a microwave, you'll never have to cook again. But for somebody who is gluten-free, it's like walking through a hallway of people shouting, Hey! Look at this delicious food you can't eat!ù and stuffing their faces full of orange chicken, maintaining direct eye contact. But wait ¶ what's that? Ah, a glowing oasis in a wheat-laden desert: Trader Joe's gluten-free nuggets. Our friends at Trader Joe's have officially titled them Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets,ù which seemed a little pretentious to me. Nuggets have, and always will be, a humble food. However, I was able to separate the nug from the name and take an unbiased look at these little morsels. Verdict: They're pretty good! They come raw, which might be a little inconvenient if you don't have a meat thermometer. However, if you turn them halfway through and cook them as per the box instructions, they end up at around 190 degrees, far above the safe temperature for chicken. The breading was thick and well seasoned, but it was a little bit chewy. This chewy texture may be your thing, but it wasn't mine, and I'm the one in charge here so I had to knock off a point for that. The flavor of the breading was pretty solid; it's well seasoned and you can taste the other spices used, like garlic powder. Overall, these are solid nuggets but lose points in the texture of their breading and the extra care it takes to cook them.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Ian's Gluten-Free Chicken Nuggets Score: 3/10 Considering I purchased these at Sprouts, which sells their own far superior brand of GF nuggets, there's not really a reason to buy these. Like the Trader Joe's ones, these are not pre-cooked. However, putting them in the oven at 400 degrees for 14 minutes, as recommended, will render them safe by a margin of 30 degrees, so no worries there. The breading isn't seasoned very well, just adding a bit of salty flavor to the chicken. However, it is really nicely textured with a great crunch. Unfortunately, the texture of the inside was ¶ not ideal. Despite being cooked to around 190 degrees, it was very moist. Not in the perfectly cooked chickenù kind of way, but rather in the did somebody accidentally spill water on my nugget?ù kind of way. No thanks.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Sprouts' Gluten-Free Chicken Nuggets† Score: 9/10 Two things struck me about the Sprouts nuggets: for one, their size. For some reason, all of the gluten-free nuggets I had tried in the past had been around the same, underwhelming size. These bad boys were heftier. Nugs with a capital N. This extra size worked really well in their favor as it created more surface area for the breading, which was the second thing that struck me. The breading was by far the most delicious out of any in this group. I usually eat my nuggets with a side of yellow mustard, but honestly, these could be eaten without your dip of choice and you'd be perfectly satisfied. They're salted perfectly, and you can actually taste the spices listed on the box! My one gripe with these nuggets was the texture of the breading, but that falls on me. The box instructs you to flip them halfway through their tenure in the oven, which I scoffed at and entirely ignored. The side that was facedown ended up a little mushy instead of crisp. I won't take points away for that, though, because it's a product of my laziness (a problem that lies far deeper than what can be revealed by the ingredients list on a box of chicken nuggets).† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Applegate Organics' Gluten-Free Chicken Nuggets Score: 9/10 While I think the Sprouts brand nuggets are a little tastier, I've put the Applegate nuggets at a tie due to how committed Applegate is to sourcing sustainably raised meat. They tout their use of humanely raised chickens on the box and give a spiel on the back about how they source their meat from family-owned, responsible farms. I try to buy responsibly raised meat whenever I can and am a big supporter of sustainable farms, so I give huge props to Applegate for making it a priority. Unfortunately, this comes with a price increase, but I say it's worth it. The nuggets themselves are pretty solid! They're a little smaller than the Sprouts ones, but their breading is tasty and never comes out soggy when cooked according to the directions on the box. The texture of the inside is great as well. I love to eat these ones with some yellow mustard, but on my laziest and mustardless days, I have eaten them plain and they hold up on their own. These are a great choice if you're looking to eat some nuggets and save the planet at the same time. I hope that the next time you're at the market, this guide makes your nugget quest a little less directionless. However, these are just my preferences. And while I'd like to believe that I have the final say when it comes to gluten-free nuggets, everybody has their own tastes. Feel free to go on your own nug-fueled odyssey and find what works for you. Worst comes to worst, you get to eat a lot of chicken nuggets.†

on-the-menu,What Students Eat During Desperate Times,9-Nov-20,12:34 AM,"['Celine Pun', 'Nicole Wakeland', 'Maya Salem']",https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-09/what-students-eat-during-desperate-times/,"It is easy to think that the homebound time we have gained from this pandemic has made us better chefs. Fridges are bulging more than ever before and everyone is learning how to mince garlic î after all, foodie Instagrams were created to flex this adulting skill.† However, behind the scenes, not every plate is photo-worthy. Sometimes, there are too many back-to-back meetings that require participation. Sometimes, cooking just seems like too much work. Sometimes, four hours of sleep does not give us enough energy to light a stove, season our ingredients and wash dishes.† Our desperation can create interestingù definitions of what constitutes a meal, but that's okay. Desperation food still provides nutrients.† We were wondering what our fellow UCSB students consume during their desperate times, so we asked around î virtually, of course.†Here are their responses: Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Ramen Since Nissin created the first Cup Noodles in 1971, instant ramen has remained a staple product for many college students. Nothing beats how affordable and effortless it takes to whip up a bowl of this desperation meal. According to the responses from our interviewees, ramen's reputation won't change any time soon. Jenlane Feng, a third-year math major who is the number one simp for Sykkuno: A lot of Shin ramen. Chop up garlic and fry that in oil. Then, boil water. Then, noodles. Crack an egg î soft boiled egg.ù Hak Zhang, a third-year CCS physics major who is a Hawaiian bread and philosophy enthusiast: Cup noodles î water in a mug at CCS building and heat it in the microwave and put it in the noodles. If there is sesame oil that is not mine but there, I will use it.ù Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Sandwiches With the most basic ingredients and the right sauce, a sandwich can turn out pretty tasty. Not to mention, sandwiches don't take long to make î a perfect snack on the go. In desperate times, we will resort to the old elementary school classic: the peanut butter and jelly.† Richard Yang, a third-year CCS physics major who has eye strain from looking at shrimp embryos: A sandwich: two pieces of toast from the [Associated Students] Food Bank. Lettuce rinsed under tap water. Slices of tomato. Choice of bacon or sausages. Optionally grilled on the pan. Add mayo and Thousand Island as see fit.ù Pierre Thibodeaux, a third-year CCS physics major who turns in homework too early and is bad at chess: Anything can be a sandwich with two slices of bread.ù Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Rice† When in doubt, rice can complement or become a nutritious meal. Full of vitamins, like vitamin E and potassium, as well as protein, rice may be the best option for a quick meal. It's low in fat and high in starchy carbohydrates î which makes rice so filling. Whether rice is cooked in the microwave, on the stove or in a rice cooker, rice is perfect for desperate times. Rei Landsberger, a third-year CCS physics major who is a Clash Royale clan dictator playing tennis at two in the morning: I like my natto and I like my short-grain Japanese rice. I can eat bowls of that shit.ù Thibodeaux, also a sandwich advocate, agrees: I am Asian so eating things over rice is also very convenient.ù Desserts† In desperate times, we are allowed to treat ourselves. Incorporating sweetness î whether it is processed or naturally occurring î brings some light into dreary times. For example, throwing some banana bread in the oven is a tasty way to repurpose week-old bananas sitting on the counter. Another quick way is by adding more fruit to your freezer to later add to smoothies, niceù creams or sparkling water, or to be fried in pancakes, consumed as is or defrosted in the microwave. Paige Dixon, a third-year physics and CCS writing and literature double major who is taking 21 units and has eyes for Hans Zimmer: Oatmeal because I can make it one day and eat it another. Add walnuts, cinnamon, maple syrup and bananas. I also finally started baking some stuff like banana bread and pumpkin crisps like what they make at Carillo [Dining Commons].ù Ruining Zhang, a third-year CCS physics major who doesn't put Sriracha on everything anymore: Yogurt. Layer frozen berries on the bottom, microwave for 20 seconds. Put Chobani greek yogurt î plain. Add coconut flakes, some granola and almond butter if there is some. Recently, feeling lazier: frozen dumplings, frozen turkey pot pie.ù Brooke Bennet, a second-year environmental studies major who's a puzzle connoisseur when watching Community: Luna bar. Chocolate chip granola bars. Hot Cheetos. Dark chocolate. Caje vanilla latte. [Kyle's] Kitchen's ahi burgers.ù Frozen Food† Frozen food, whether bought or meal-prepped, is the most popular choice for desperate dining. Trader Joe's and Costco are affordable stores to obtain all your frozen amenities. Not only are the foods well-prepared, but 2 a.m. breakfasts also require less than 10 minutes to make. The convenience of this concept is genius, and we are totally here for it. Also, don't forget the best thing about frozen food: shelf life extends to weeks!† Brenda Nusiem, a third-year financial mathematics and statistics major who is a sucker for horror movies and wine: Pepperoni Hot Pocket. Kraft mac and cheese to-go cups. I am such a big chicken tenders advocate. Pre-made fries. Frozen Mexican food: quesadillas, burritos. A lot of Taco Bell, McDonald's and Chick-fil-A.ù Landon Loock, a financial mathematics and statistics alumnus who plays a bit too much basketball during the pandemic but still rocks a smile in his voice: Pot pies. Chicken bakes. Both from Costco. Frozen pizza. Not the best but so good.ù Amy Lam, third-year biological anthropology major who binges Netflix shows religiously: Anything that is frozen and cooks easily like Trader Joe's gnocchi. Add a little kale. The food my parents make.ù Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Others Desperate times are sometimes like the day before grocery shopping: a near-hollowed fridge, unrecognizable foods stashed in corners and menial leftovers scattered in Tupperware containers. Sometimes, these crazy ideas can turn into surprisingly fine dining. Grab a little protein, toss in some wilting produce and finish the meal with some old sauce.† Hannah Morley, a fourth-year CCS writing and literature major who's a bubbly Animorphs stan: Shitton eggs î eggs and whatever I have around the house: spinach, tomato, onion, sometimes chicken sausage. Lemon pepper seasoning.ù Michelle Chiu, a fourth-year CCS biology major who's the person in the CCS Community Council listening to Blackpink and doing everything: My grandmother mass-produces green onion pancakes. Mash up some avocado and hummus and add some arugula, sometimes cucumbers and tomato or tempeh. Sprinkle some salt and pepper and chili flakes.ù† Rhett MaGee, a first-year transfer anthropology major who enjoys drumming, gardening and the Beatles: Chicken. Tacos. Salad mix but only from [Grocery Outlet] Bargain Market. Sierra Nevadas and IPAs. Extra calories. Clif bars and espressos.ù† Not all of our cooking adventures are social-media worthy, but they can help us survive the day î or week. In hindsight, ramen for breakfast, lunch and dinner is not recommended, but at least knowing where your next meal comes from is a favor in disguise. With the experience gained from handling desperate times, we can accomplish anything.† Fingers crossed, of course, that such times won't befall us again.

on-the-menu,Two Easy Ways To Jazz Up Instant Coffee,10-Nov-20,11:35 PM,['Christine Tu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-10/two-easy-ways-to-jazz-up-instant-coffee/,"Instant coffee is pretty simple: Spoon some powder into a mug and add hot water. But to many coffee fans (or coffee snobs), it's pretty much treason to be caught with such a basic, unfancy drink. However, instant coffee has several benefits: it's quick, cheap and does the trick (aka has enough caffeine to wake you up).† But if you make your typical Costco-brand instant coffee (I use Nescaf√©'s Taster's Choice House Blend) according to the instructions of just adding water, the results are pretty bland. Sure, you have coffee, but it's more like dark, soupy water that's bitter and only good when piping hot.† But it doesn't have to be that way. Here are two easy ways to jazz up your instant coffee game! Christine Tu / Daily Nexus 1) Instant Coffee Latte This summer, the TikTok trend of dalgona coffee blew up and had everyone and their mother trying out this instant coffee recipe. But for those who don't have the time to get those famous stiff peaks whipped, here's an easy hack to get that same latte effect.† 2) Nutella coffee For those who are totally obsessed with this sweet topping and can eat it straight from the jar, consider adding it to your daily coffee! The sugar is perfect for countering the natural bitterness of instant coffee, and the nutty chocolate flavor makes it so much more delicious.† There are also several fun variations that you could use for both recipes. For example, instead of Nutella, chocolate powder or peanut butter make great substitutes. In the end, instant coffee may get a bad rap for being bitter and, well, instant. But making these simple changes can make it seem like you're drinking freshly made Starbucks for a fraction of the price!

One of the chain's most popular drinks is their Iced Mint Mojito, and for good reason. While coffee and mint may seem like an odd combination at first, the bitterness of the coffee is perfectly complemented by the sweet, refreshing notes of mint, and the drink itself is so smooth and creamy.† With a price tag of $5 a cup, however, Philz's Iced Mint Mojito is definitely not cheap. But with just a few simple ingredients that you probably already have in your kitchen, you can recreate this iconic drink on a budget, super easily! Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Directions: Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus While nothing can really beat the authentic Philz's Iced Mint Mojito, this recipe is a great alternative for those who do not live near a Philz Coffee. The secret to this recipe is letting the crushed mint leaves steep in the hot coffee to get that hint of mint, and topping the drink with cream to mimic the creaminess of Philz Coffee drinks. Even for people who are not familiar with Philz, this DIY Iced Mint Mojito is a fun, easy way to elevate your typical iced coffee!

on-the-menu,Kyle's Kitchen Isla Vista: The New Krispy Chicken Sandwich,12-Nov-20,12:37 AM,['Nicole Wakeland'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-12/kyles-kitchen-isla-vista-the-new-krispy-chicken-sandwich/,"Kyle's Kitchen, a fast-casual restaurant with a variety of healthy comfort food options, recently opened its newest location in Isla Vista, replacing Silvergreens on the corner of Pardall and Embarcadero Del Mar. The menu highlights all of the most popular burgers, salads and the new Krispy Chicken Sandwich that everyone has been craving, and I knew I had to try it after seeing lines out the door for this hot commodity.† Courtesy of Kyle's Kitchen Upon entering Kyle's I.V., I was welcomed by lively employees and a clean, inviting atmosphere. There was a sign reading, Our buns melt in your mouth!ù Right then I was intrigued. I wanted to try an array of items on the menu, so I got the Seared Ahi salad, the Krispy Chicken Sandwich and their Hand Cut French Fries.† First, I tried the salad which I noticed comes in a pop bowl. This is a plastic bowl that's packaged tightly with a lid, and the bottom expands when you're ready to pour in the dressing and shake it up. This cool and convenient concept is original to Kyle's Kitchen and has been used in Kyle's locations for a while now. It's also reusable so you can take it home to use for your own salads.† The Seared Ahi salad included a mix of fresh field greens, napa cabbage, mandarin oranges, wonton strips and a sesame ginger dressing. I thought the flavors blended perfectly, and it was refreshing and delicious. I loved the dressing and the crunch that the wontons bring to the dish as a whole. This was a great start to my taste test and I would definitely go back for this salad again! Then I tried the Krispy Chicken Sandwich which has been getting lots of attention from locals in Isla Vista. It pairs fried chicken with either their OG Garlic Aioli or Kyle's Spicy Sauce and dill pickles î all on a brioche bun. I opted for the spicy version. The chicken itself was very juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside which created the perfect combination of textures. The saltiness from the pickles and tanginess from the spicy sauce added bursts of flavor to the sandwich. However, I thought the whole ensemble was quite simple since it only included two ingredients besides the bun and the patty. After taking my first few bites, I noticed that the bun really did melt in my mouth. It was soft, sweet and warm which made all the difference.† I later found out about a perfect alternative that would satisfy my need for the perfect chicken sandwich. Kyle's allows you to substitute their Krispy Chicken Breast onto any of their other burgers which include ingredients such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, jalapenos and crispy onion strings. Next time I visit Kyle's, I will definitely try this option out. However, if you like to keep things simple, the Krispy Chicken Sandwich (as is) would be perfect for you.† The Hand Cut French Fries are double fried and sprinkled with the perfect amount of herbs and seasoning. I loved how these had a bold flavor and a crunchy texture. When I first heard they were double fried, I was worried they would be too hard, but they were cooked to perfection.

This business blended their love for food and special needs philanthropy when creating the concept of Kyle's Kitchen in 2015. The family's sixteen-year-old son, Kyle, inspired this concept and represents the face of the company.† Emily Kadri, the marketing manager at Kyle's Kitchen, explained that Kyle was born with an undiagnosed brain injury and has had to work really hard to get to where he is today in terms of mobility and speech. Kyle resembles the perfect special needs ambassador as he is very social and loves greeting customers with a big hug and a smile. Pre-covid, Kyle would visit the different locations a few times a week which became such a big part of the restaurant,ù Kadri said. He loves to sit and chat with the customers and brings such a calming and positive presence whenever he's there. Recently, Kyle has been making fewer appearances as he's doing his part and quarantining, but Kadri says that he's so looking forward to getting back out there.ù† Courtesy of Kyle's Kitchen As far as the family's main goals for Kyle's Kitchen, one, in particular, was to educate customers and the community on those with special needs. They communicate and bring awareness to the fact that the special needs spectrum is extremely vast. This message has allowed Kyle and many others like him to reach their potential since they are able to have a safe space to express themselves, socialize, and make friends.† It's evident that Kyle's condition has not stopped him from giving back to others and making a huge positive impact within his community. Philanthropy was another one of the family's ambitions for the restaurant. Since opening in 2015, Kyle's Kitchen has given back over $200,000 to local special needs organizations. They have worked with over 30 local special needs partners and are always looking to extend their helping hand to other organizations within this community.†† As COVID-19 has taken a toll on everyone, it has especially impacted families that have members with special needs. Many regular support services that give these children structure or care have been canceled or reduced which forces parents out of work and into their homes. Not to mention, people with special needs have a compromised immune system making it easier for them to get sick.† Knowing these added difficulties from first-hand experience, Kyle's Kitchen has worked hard to help feed other local special needs families during this time. They have now reached 5,000 family members with both children and adults that have special needs and have donated almost 1,000 free meals to these families.† In order to continue helping this community, Kyle's Kitchen is creating exciting new aspects that cater to the Isla Vista locals. Kadri shared that within the next month they plan on launching a Kyle's Kitchen App which will highlight a new rewards program with easier and cheaper online ordering and delivery.† Eat Great Food. Help Great Peopleù is their slogan and it's clearly true. Next time you're in downtown Isla Vista, don't forget to come into Kyle's and find out what you're missing! Maybe one day you'll be able to meet Kyle himself.

Here's how to downscale some of your favorite flavors to either share with your housemates or hoard all to yourself! Rachel Dye / Daily Nexus Pan-Fried Turkey Cutlets Roasting a whole turkey is a big hassle, especially when only 1-4 people are eating.

on-the-menu,5 Fun Plant-Based Desserts for Thanksgiving,24-Nov-20,12:25 AM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-24/5-fun-plant-based-desserts-for-thanksgiving/,"Thanksgiving has always been a great excuse to visit my church and catch up with old friends, but with the pandemic this year, my Thanksgiving might just be a hearty potluck with international friends and housemates. For a typical potluck around the holidays, I would usually bring a sweet potato casserole with marshmallows, but this year, I had the time to be a little more adventurous.†Here are some incredible plant-based desserts from that baking adventure:††† Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Apple Crisp When I was peeling the plump apples my mom gifted me with when she visited me from Los Angeles, I thought of the poem, To Autumnù by John Keats. These apples remind me of the peak of autumn that Keats describes, where everything has grown ripe and big, threatening to spoil. These apples were the size of my face, and I was desperate to finish them as some of them were beginning to brown.† This recipe comes from the Minimalist Baker,ù a vegan blog by Dana Shultz. Although I cut this recipe in half to fit my 9-by-9-inch baking tin, this recipe is a great way to eat a ton of apples. The recipe calls for pecans, but I used unsalted mixed nuts from Costco instead. I also added a tablespoon of flax seeds for omega-3 fatty acids. The crunchy topping î in contrast with the silkiness of the apple filling î is always everyone's favorite part.† Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Chinese Almond Cookies† These were my favorite cookies growing up. I remember the winter holidays when we ate at Chinese restaurants with the tables turning. At the end of every meal, the waiters would always plate these cookies with the check. I would always forward to the crunchy grittiness of those sweet cookies.† This recipe is from healthy nibbles,ù a blog by Lisa Lin. As my friends had gifted me with a Ninja Mega Kitchen System BL770 î a blender and food processor kitchen appliance î I just had to make my own oat flour with the food processor attachment. I tried to veganize the recipe by replacing the eggs with 2 tablespoons of a flax seeds-water solution, but the cookies did not hold their shape. They flattened, even after they sat in the freezer for 10 minutes. I wanted to brush the tops of the cookies with coconut oil as an egg wash, but I forgot. Still, this brought nostalgia to my tongue.† Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls The only two times I have made cinnamon rolls from scratch was during the pandemic. The second time was because I was desperate to use the pumpkin puree cluttering my pantry. Proofing three times î while blooming the yeast, before the rolling and after the rolling î gave me this humbling experience, teaching me both patience and generosity. This recipe also helped me not procrastinate; I participated in Zoom meetings and read The Distance Between Us: A Memoirù by Reyna Grande while I waited.† This recipe is by Britt from her vegan blog, The Banana Diaries.ù I kind of cheated and threw all the ingredients into the Ninja BL770 food processor. The dough was extremely sticky, but I tossed it in a bowl and left it in the turned-off oven î which is also my favorite baking hack to reduce plastic Saran wrap usage î for an hour. I used soy milk and added a tablespoon of flaxseeds. The dough came out fluffier than soap suds in a summer bath. I dipped the tops in leftover maple-coconut glaze. My friends and I vouch for this being the best recipe for cinnamon rolls out there.† Sweet Potato Casserole with Marshmallows If you ask me what my favorite Thanksgiving dessert is, I would say it is this sweet potato casserole. Every Thanksgiving at my church, there would be a buffet with this dessert at the end. The marshmallows were gently toasted and had a nice shell. The creamy sweet potato underneath was refreshing compared to the savory main course and sides. I always wondered how they made it, so I looked up this recipe.† This recipe is by Katie Higgins of Chocolate Covered Katie.ù The casserole has the perfect golden crisp on the marshmallows, matching the silky sweet potato underneath. I used a 9-by-9-inch baking tin and therefore cut the recipe in half. Fun hack: Use canned sweet potato for convenience. I also drizzled flax seeds on top of the sweet potato mix for more nutrition. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Pumpkin Scones One of my favorite pastries to get at cafes is scones. I love the soft, crumbly texture with the hard shell. I love the gloss from the glaze. I love how it is socially acceptable to enjoy tea with your scone for breakfast or after a hearty dinner.† This recipe is by Food Network, and I did not use their recommended glaze because I did not have any powdered sugar. I made a brown sugar-and-coconut milk glaze by adding º cup of each into a pan on low heat. Then I added a tablespoon of cold coconut oil, a dash of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of salt. I smashed some pecans to add as a topping, too.† With these recipes in mind, I hope your COVID-conscious Thanksgiving will be elevated upon sharing good food with good company!

on-the-menu,Five Ways To Use Extra Pumpkin Puree: Savory Plant-Based Edition,25-Nov-20,12:29 AM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-25/five-ways-to-use-extra-pumpkin-puree-savory-plant-based-edition/,"Bless the food banks for offering cans of pumpkin puree in preparation for the upcoming autumn holidays. Not going to lie, the five cans between my family and friends sparked joy and stress at the same time. Having an excess of anything feels suffocating in a clutter-free space, so I decided to look for ways to make the most of this pumpkin abundance. Here are five of my favorite savory pumpkin recipes:† Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Gnocchi† This is the third time I have tried making gnocchi. This chewy pasta is made with boiled potato, all-purpose flour and a little salt for flavor. Adding pumpkin puree elevates this dish with a hearty sweetness. Formed from rolling logs into bee shapes, this gnocchi is fun to make with friends and family. I used a recipe from Sweet Simple Vegan,ù a vegan blog run by partners Jasmine and Chris. I did not have sage leaves, though; part of me wanted to go for a walk on the cliffs by Manzanita Village, plucking leaves from the purple sage bushes. However, dried thyme was in my spice rack so I tossed a tablespoon of that into my extra garlicky butter sauce, having doubled the number of garlic cloves as I am pro-garlic. I bet dried basil or dried parsley (or either fresh) would have added a similar savory herb kick to this dish, as well. I also stuffed some of the gnocchi balls with cheese, because why not? Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Soup Autumn is the unspoken start of soup season. I have made corn chowder, miso soup and this morning: pumpkin soup. Leaving the soup in a big pot on the stove and sipping it throughout the day is a clever way to have convenient meals during a busy day.† This recipe is from Salt & Lavender,ù a vegan blog by Natasha Bull. I used soy milk instead of coconut milk because bulk soy milk from Costco is cheaper for someone who consumes soy milk religiously and is out of coconut milk. My pantry is abundant with canned corn, so I popped one in. I doubled the garlic clove count as well. Finally, no creamy vegan soup is complete without being drowned in nooch (nutritional yeast).† Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Curry Curries are one of my favorite meals because they tend to be made from one-pot recipes and I can mass produce them for meal prepping. If I was feeling lazy, I would buy Japanese curry blocks instead of playing with the seasonings in my spice rack and heat up instant rice.† This dish is loosely based on a recipe by Shannon from her vegan blog Yup, it's Vegan!ù First, sweat the aromatics: onion, garlic, ginger. Add curry powder, then the rest of the ingredients. I soaked my lentils that morning so I only boiled them for 10 minutes and used soy milk instead of coconut milk. I also added celery, but I should have also sweated the celery as it was too crunchy, even after sitting in the vegetable broth for 10 minutes. I wanted to add carrots and potatoes, but my midweek fridge was hollow from skipping a grocery shopping run on the weekend. My housemates and I felt that this curry was missing something, so we drowned the curry in mirin and sugar, simmering it for longer. I paired the curry with my favorite Thai jasmine rice and topped it with nooch. Pasta Sauce If you are tired of using traditional marinara or Alfredo sauce with your penne or spaghetti, try this pumpkin pasta sauce. Adding a refreshing autumn zing to an affordable meal for college students makes cooking a worthier experience.† This recipe is by Jolinda Hackett of The Spruce Eatsù blog. I love how this recipe is a one-pot kind of recipe and I already had everything in my pantry from the Associated Students Food Bank. Pumpkin has such a sweet flavor, but pouring it over sauteed onions and garlic gives the pumpkin a refreshing salty undertone. Adding some grated ginger and lemon zest spices this recipe up even more. Drowning the sauce in nooch is also a classic plant-based move.†† Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Biscuits Growing up, I was obsessed with biscuits. My family often went to KFC and Popeyes, and I would look forward to their biscuits every time. The buttery, flaky pastry pairs nicely with any hearty meal, including curries and soups. I love peeling the layers with my fingers, savoring the biscuits in my mouth.† This recipe is by Richa of Vegan Richa,ù and I love her suggestion of adding herbs to the batter. I added thyme and parsley because I did not have sage on hand. I also folded the dough several times to create flaky layers like for croissants, except the dough never went into the freezer. Then, I brushed the top with coconut oil in an attempt to create that golden-brown coat, but I do not think that it made any difference.† The early mornings spent baking and cooking perfused our house with scents of cinnamon and sighs of satisfaction from my housemates, turning pumpkin stress into a fun autumn experience.

Even if you don't live in a two-bedroom college apartment with a minuscule kitchen, sheet pans, in particular, are hard to store due to their size and shape which are not conducive to cabinetry. However, you might have spied a curious drawer under your oven, seemingly perfectly sized to store sheet pans and other similar oven tools. While storing pans there is a perfectly valid option, you might be amazed to know that those drawers serve another purpose.† Rachel Dye / Daily Nexus That is the site of your oven's broiler, or at the very least, its food warming station. Broiling is a technique where a source of high heat is concentrated at the top of the food, unlike baking which surrounds the food with hot air or cooking on the stove which heats food from the bottom up. Broiling is especially good for things like browning the top of casseroles, toasting bread and cooking things that don't need a lot of time like fish or steak. However, achieving this fairly easy technique does require some knowledge of how your oven functions and where you need to place food in order to broil it.† Gas ovens tend to have their source of flame at the bottom of the oven, while electric ovens have heating coils at both the bottom and the top. An easy way to tell if your oven is electric or gas is to turn it on, and see where it is glowing. If your oven has metal coils on either the top or bottom that heat up and glow, then it is an electric oven. If when turned on, your oven starts to glow from the bottom with heat coming up from slits on the floor, it's a gas oven.† In electric ovens, the broiler can either be found at the bottom or the top, depending on where your oven has those coils. If at the top, any foods that you want to broil you simply place them on the top rack at the highest possible position for your oven, and turn on your oven to the broilù setting. Drawers underneath top-broiling electric ovens are usually created to serve as food warmers, where you turn on your oven to a low setting and place pans of food to keep them warm for situations like parties and holiday gatherings.† Rachel Dye / Daily Nexus In gas ovens and bottom-broiling electric ovens, the drawer then serves as the broiler drawer. In order to use it, you simply set your oven to broil,ù let the oven heat up and put the food in the drawer so that the top of it is close to the source of heat. It's simple and easy! I used it to cook a bone-in, New York strip steak and paired it with a simple caprese salad, which took me less than 30 minutes, including prep. The possibilities are endless, and you can still employ it as pan storage when not in use! I recommend that you take out any pans you have in the drawer prior to heating your oven to prevent burns, as I learned the hard way.†

on-the-menu,Tips for Cooking With Eczema,3-Dec-20,1:36 AM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-03/tips-for-cooking-with-eczema/,"Tips for Cooking With Eczema When everyone retreated into their kitchen during the pandemic, I was hesitant to follow. The aromas of scallion pancakes, hearty sourdough and dalgona coffee beckoned, but eczema screamed louder. This chronic skin condition î atopic dermatitis î is a whack-a-mole rash from mysterious inflammations, leaving drought cracks and scarlet blisters in its wake.† I am not the only one cursed: 10% of adults suffer from eczema. With more homebound time from the pandemic, there is no surprise that most of us have fallen into the temptation of baking banana bread. More baking and more cooking means more flare up of dry patches for us. Here are five tips I learned from cooking with eczema that college students can practice for better cooking experiences.††† Joyce Tsui / Daily Nexus Keep your kitchen space clean. Nobody likes a crusty kitchen. Dust and grease cling like expired lotion and accidentally brushing an old food splatter with an elbow is like stepping in dog poop.† I enjoy getting together with my housemates at least once a month to do a thorough cleanse of our shared space. Someone organizes the pantry. Someone dances with the vacuum or mop. Someone exfoliates the microwave and backsplash.† Pre-pandemic, I slept over at a friend's, and, in the morning, she called a house meeting. They set a five-minute timer and aggressively tidied their living space. Stray water cups were cleaned. Spices returned to their rack. Physics-worn paper tucked in the recycling bin.† † Minimize excessively washing hands. Especially living in Santa Barbara, where tap water is hard water from high calcium and magnesium levels, washing hands excessively irritates the skin. Washing your hands is so effective, it also erodes the oil in your skin that naturally locks in mositure. If you do need to wash your hands, reduce contact with extremely hot water and instead of rubbing dry, pat dry. Then, add moisturizer to prevent more dryness. If it is not necessary to wash with water and soap, try using hand sanitizer instead. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin as well, but it is enough to rid of germs after touching a communal door knob or microwave door without leaving visible impurities like dirt on hands.† Invest in a dishwasher. Not only does this prevent drying out your skin as there is minimal contact with hard water, using a dishwasher saves more water than hand-washing dishes.†† Invite your housemates to cook and feast. Not only is cooking a great bonding time, splitting the dishes diminishes outrageous water time with hands. † Cook with air circulation. Growing up in an Asian household, my parents always open the doors and windows and turn on their vent hood. They shut bathroom and bedroom doors, so the scent of ginger and garlic does not linger in our sheets. There is a time and a place for good smelling food, they seem to say. Living away from home, I remember the fear of residual cooking smell. An oven to roast sweet potato or a slow cooker to whip up curry can fume the home with fragrance, a warm hug during winter days, creating a greasy film from fumes lingering the following day. This film feels sticky and dries out my skin. It is like trying to wriggle out of a hug from your least favorite uncle with a beer belly and garlicky breath.† † Wear personal protective equipment.† If someone asks me what my favorite kitchen utensil is, I would say the green rubber gloves I purchased at Isla Vista Food Cooperative. Doing dishes with cracked and blistered skin from eczema is frustrating, but with reusable gloves, I know that I can indulge in the cooking process without marginal damages to my skin.† Additionally, gloves can prevent contact with particles that can cause irritating reactions. I use the disposable nitrile gloves my mom gave me to wear whenever I go grocery shopping to protect my hands from COVID-19 and the allergens and irritants in my kitchen. These gloves fit more comfortably than reusable rubber gloves. Therefore, I use them when I am chopping, whisking and handling food.† † Avoid ingredients that flare your skin. Most people know not to eat something they are allergic to, but with eczema, the allergic reaction is less noticeable. Cracked skin bursts out of nowhere.† Exclusion or elimination diets are diets that strictly avoid food that is suspected to influence eczema. This diet varies from person to person and tends to work when food allergies are acknowledged. For example, as I am lactose intolerant, I grow bloated and eczema speckles the skin on my joints more when consuming dairy. Dubliner and string cheese are worth sacrificing when I do not have to lather Vaseline on dry spots every hour. I like to think that eczema is a blessing too, reminding me to be more present in caring for myself and my kitchen. I hope sharing my experience has helped you with yours.† Celine Pun has been an Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion For Dry Skin addict for 16 years. Actual research shows no relationship between lactose intolerance and eczema. Sorry Ms Pun, but let's stick to real facts and not your anecdotal opinion.

Glistening golden yolks peek out from behind tender slices of meat, and noodles swim in herb-garnished broth. I lean forward, and jolt awake to the familiar buzzing of my alarm. Top ramen and takeout eradicate my decadent dreams of homemade cuisine ¶ At least, that's how it was before quarantine. After the initial shock of being inside practically 24/7, I decided that I would use the extra time to sharpen my kitchen skills, so to speak. Who doesn't fantasize about posting cute, home-made, foodieù content on their Instagram? Plus, I've always wanted to wear one of those infamous kiss the cookù aprons! Unfortunately, trying to take on every aspect of cooking at once was baking me crazy! Smoke billowed from the oven where my latest attempt at chocolate chip cookies had turned into a charcoal catastrophe, and I vividly envisioned Gordon Ramsay pronouncing me an idiot sandwich.ù Well, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen! So, I did. I took a break from my culinary conquest for a few months. But, when I moved to my aunt and uncle's house in September, I was once again forced to open the kitchen cabinet and cook ¶† because both of them are graduates of culinary school!

Since going vegan, I receive the same comments over and over again. People always ask me, If you don't eat animal products, do you just eat vegetables all day?ù and How do you get any protein in?ù In reality, vegan diets can still be balanced and provide enough protein, despite relying on only plants. Over the past few months, I've learned how to be creative with my vegan meals and find alternatives for my favorite animal product-based foods. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Breakfast Breakfast is definitely my favorite meal of the day. I used to love the Birch Benders Paleo mix, but since going vegan, I've been loving their Plant Protein mix. Luckily, this pancake mix is always in stock at the IV Food Co-op! Additionally, I use chia seeds in my batter to act as an egg replacement. Since the chia seeds absorb liquid, it really helps with the fluff factor! Here's how I whip up protein-packed vegan pancakes in the morning. Ingredients: Directions: Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Lunch After a few hours of studying, it's time for lunch. I usually opt for a veggie wrap of some sorts or a tofu scramble. I used to be a big scrambled egg person, but now eggs kind of gross me out. Trust me, you won't miss eggs with this vegan scramble. Ingredients: Directions: Tofu is packed with protein and pairing your scramble with whole wheat toast and avocado will keep you satisfied instead of feeling snack-y all afternoon long. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Snack After my afternoon workout, I look forward to a protein smoothie to help my muscles recover. Especially since I usually do strength training, fueling after I work out is so important. Here's a protein smoothie that I create, usually using Sun Warrior protein. Ingredients: Directions: Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Dinner I've been loving hearty grain bowls for dinner because they only take a few minutes to make. Since there is no strict recipe for grain bowls, they are a highly customizable dinner option. To ensure that my bowls are balanced, I use this formula when I make them: A third of the bowl is composed of a hearty grain, another third of the bowl is a plant-based protein source and the other third can be any veggie of your choosing! Here's my go-to combination: Ingredients: Directions:† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Dessert Since I have a sweet tooth, I always need some sort of chocolate at night.

on-the-menu,Up All Night for Insomnia Cookies,10-Dec-20,12:54 AM,['Charlotte Glass'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-10/up-all-night-for-insomnia-cookies/,"For those with a sweet tooth and nocturnal disposition, I advise you to proceed with caution. Knowledge gained from this article may break your bank account.†† Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus In 2003, University of Pennsylvania student Seth Berkowitz began baking and delivering cookies around campus from his dorm room after identifying an opening in the market of late-night munchies: sweets. From there, a make-shift delivery service progressively evolved into a $500-million cookie franchise. Insomnia Cookies, open between 10 a.m. and 3 a.m. from Monday to Friday and between 12 p.m. and 3 a.m. on weekends, is perfectly designed for the erratic sleep schedules and insatiable appetites of college students î literally. Most of the company's 155 stores line college campuses, where students time and time again fall prey to the temptation of convenient carbohydrates in the dark hours of the night. Last Sunday, I was one of those students.† Upon browsing Insomnia Cookies' menu, I was floored by my options. With classic flavors, deluxe packages, òwiches, cookie cakes, ice cream and even chocolate milk, every sugary flavor and texture appears at your disposal. In fact, Insomnia Cookies offers a few options for those with dietary restrictions, including three vegan cookies î Vegan Chocolate Chunk, Vegan Double Chocolate Chunk, and Vegan Birthday Cake î the last of which was (spoiler alert) my favorite purchase. Pleased with the mere $3 delivery fee (INSANE), I waited patiently for the variety pack that I ordered for me and my roommates to sample. Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus After a brief knock on the front door 30 minutes later, everyone raced to the kitchen. The room-temperature box, however, provided a bit of disappointment î Insomnia Cookies has made piping-hot cookies the focal point of its advertising. These cookies could not even be described as warmish. Maybe this was just a fluke, but I could imagine many obstacles in maintaining temperature throughout transportation. Needless to say, when I went for a classic chocolate chip, I was not greeted with the gooey texture and melted chocolate that I had dreamed of. I quickly decided that the Chocolate Chunk was a bust î something one might receive as a complimentary item at a hotel buffet or diner. The Oatmeal Raisin and Sugar cookies were equally generic and twice as dry. The Snickerdoodle, however, represented a significant improvement with its playful, spicy-sugary notes. Likewise, the Double Chocolate Chunk offered a fairly unique flavor î a sort of ode to hot chocolate and fudge. Nevertheless, nothing compared to the Vegan Birthday Cake cookie. Although I am not typically a fan of birthday cake flavors or any excess of vanilla, this cookie greatly outshined the others. Easily the moistest and distinctive of the bunch, the Vegan Birthday Cake cookie balanced a buttery taste with one of childish sweetness. Its rainbow confetti and smooth outer coat also gave it an appealing look. At any rate, I would recommend placing a delivery for Insomnia Cookies more for the experience than the actual product. Split a variety pack with a group of friends during a late night, but do not expect a homemade or small-town bakery taste. These are corporate cookies. Insomnia Cookies has not built a brand on the quality of its cookies î its appeal lies entirely in expediency.

The host is your first impression of your dining experience and can be a make or break factor. As a hostess for a year and a half at a five-star restaurant, I know the ins and outs of the restaurant industry. Here are five things you didn't know about being a hostess. Photo courtesy of pxhere.com You can tip a hostess. Hosts make minimum wage, on average, and rely on servers and customers to help out with cash. If we sit you in your requested spot, most likely we did a lot of work to accommodate that. In fact, Adam Sandler once gave me $5 because I refilled his coffee when his server was busy.† Where you sit actually matters. When planning out reservations, we take into account seating requests which can be but are not limited to: inside, outside, booth, table, server request, etc. Before the start of dinner, the host has perfectly planned out where everyone will be seated. We are Tetris masters, to say the least. If you walk in and ask for a new table, we will politely smile, panic and then go back to our master board and shift everything around for the next four hours.† We do more than just seat people. Sunday brunch will be the absolute death of any host. With every busy shift, the hostess turns into everyone's assistant. I remember Sundays when I would be asked to bus tables, refill waters, place to-go orders, grab coffees, etc.† Wait times are not our fault.† One of my favorite things to do was to take our restaurant's iPad, walk around the restaurant and write down what course the guest was on. On average, most restaurants plan for a two-hour turn time. Once a check is dropped at a table, we predict the guests will spend about 10 more minutes there before they leave. However, sometimes families and other guests love to chat for the next hour after they've finished their meal. I'm so sorry.† Plan ahead during the holidays. If you're a guy trying to reserve a table on Valentine's Day, I suggest planning far in advance. This goes for any holiday; when you call on Christmas Eve, asking for a table for 10 because your whole family is in town, I promise you I can't squeeze you in.ù† Plan ahead for holidays, and you'll save your host some stress.† This is such a fun job that teaches you communication skills, organizational skills and time management. The next time you go into a restaurant, I hope you'll recognize the hard work your hosts and hostesses put in.

She launched her brand Chamberlain Coffee in 2019. The company recently went through a rebrand, giving it an entirely new look and new products to feature.†† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus At the young age of 19, Chamberlain has become a successful business owner and is one of the first to implement the clever and convenient idea of steeped coffee bags. You simply put these eco-friendly coffee bags into either hot or cold water to get the perfect cup of coffee.† With the new rebranding, you can now choose from the Family Blend, the Careless Cat, the Early Bird Blend, the Social Dog Blend and the Night Owl Blend. Each one offers different roasts, caffeine levels and hints of flavor. These blends come in both fresh grounds and whole beans, but I opted to try the steeped bags as I was very curious to see how this new technology works. I chose the Social Dog Blend which has notes of milk chocolate, roasted peanuts and brown sugar, with a graham cracker finish. It also contains a caffeine level of 4 out of 5† When looking at the packaging first glance, I noticed the cutest designs with vibrant colors that would appeal to anyone and everyone. The text is clear and the directions are so easy to follow. You can tell there was a lot of thought put into the look of the products, which allows them to reach a large range of customers.† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus There are only three easy steps to preparing the cold brew:† I loved how simple and straightforward it was to make a perfect batch of cold brew. After letting the drink steep overnight, it was so quick to add a dash of creamer and run out the door. This concept is perfect for people who are often on the go! As for the flavor of the coffee itself, I loved it! You can really taste the rich undertones, and the cold brew was even delicious without creamer. It's not too acidic and I thought the caffeine level, being at a 4 out of 5, was just the right amount. I felt awake and alert, without feeling too jittery or anxious.† Chamberlain Coffee takes pride in the quality and sustainability of their ingredients and their packaging. They ensure their coffee beans are certified organic with no pesticides, and all products are freshly roasted and prepared at their local facility in California. Most importantly, this environmentally conscious brand makes sure the packaging is made with eco-friendly materials. Overall, I love the whole concept of Chamberlain Coffee. The steeped bags are genius, and the different blends make it personalized so you can choose the option that best suits you. There's a choice that represents each type of coffee drinker out there, allowing their brand to relate to so many people.†† Their motto, It's more than a drink,ù really rings true. The manner and motivation for which† you drink their coffee vary based on the mood you are in or the time of day. I know I will be trying all the different blends Chamberlain Coffee has to offer.

on-the-menu,Fulfill Your Festive Beverage Cravings with Starbucks Holiday Drinks,24-Dec-20,11:32 AM,['Nicole Wakeland'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-24/fulfill-your-festive-beverage-cravings-with-starbucks-holiday-drinks/,"Cold weather and warm drinks go hand in hand during the holiday season, and Starbucks is the place to go to fulfill all your festive drink cravings. Starting Nov. 2, Starbucks began their holiday season releasing their holiday-themed cups and limited-edition drinks.† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus This year, the festive drinks came in threes. Even though the holiday menu contains a few more items, I tried the three holiday drinks featured on Starbucks' official Instagram page including the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, the Caramel Br√ªle√© Latte, and the Peppermint Mocha. Here's an honest opinion on these drinks so you can try the one that sounds best to you.† First, I tried the Caramel Br√ªle√© Latte. This drink was warm and the sweetest of the three, but I still really enjoyed it. I liked the taste of the rich caramel flavor and the sprinkles on top, which give it some extra flavor. It contains Starbucks' signature espresso, steamed milk and a caramel br√ªl√©e sauce. A grande size is 410 calories, but in my opinion, it's totally worth it.† Up next was the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha. It's a new spin on the original White Chocolate Mocha and adds caramelized flavors which give it that toastedù flavor. This was my favorite drink of the three and it tasted similar to the Caramel Br√ªle√© Latte but was not as sweet. It comes topped with whipped cream and red candied cranberry sugar, giving it the perfect holiday touch. Containing more calories than the first drink, it has a total of 420 calories.† Lastly, I tried the Peppermint Mocha. This drink is a Starbucks holiday staple as it has been around for 18 seasons and has been imitated by other big coffee companies. It's made with espresso, steamed milk, mocha sauce and peppermint-flavored syrup, topped with whipped cream and dark chocolate curls. If you love peppermint, this drink is for you. However, I thought the minty flavor was overbearing. I couldn't really taste any sign of coffee due to the strong mocha flavor, so it felt like I was drinking hot chocolate to me. This one was my least favorite, but since it's been around for so long, I believe it's a fan-favorite. Containing the highest number of calories, the Peppermint Mocha is 440 calories in a grande size.† Overall, the holiday drinks I would order again are the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha and the Caramel Br√ªle√© Latte. I think Starbucks comes up with interesting drinks containing the best holiday flavors such as nutmeg, peppermint and caramel. It's no wonder why these festive beverages make a famous menu î they're perfect for sipping on while holiday shopping or just indulging in a delicious treat.† Keep in mind that Starbucks' holiday menu will end in mid to late January, so make sure to get your taste test in before the season ends. I know I will be going back for my favorites many times this holiday season.†

on-the-menu,A Festive Filipino Feast,27-Dec-20,4:12 PM,['Carrieanne Mamba'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-27/a-festive-filipino-feast/,"Christmas is undoubtedly a big holiday for many Americans, but for Filipino-Americans especially, Christmas is something we've been looking forward to since the -ber months. Many Filipinos start decorating their homes in preparation for Christmas starting in September, and it is not uncommon for the festivities to go through December and into the new year. The emphasis placed on this holiday brings the Christmas spirit into many elements: decorations, gift-giving, and of course, the food. Given its geographic location in Southeast Asia and its history of Spanish colonization, the Philippines has a unique cuisine that draws from different cultures. For my family's Christmas feast, we typically prepare foods with Chinese, Spanish, and distinctly Filipino roots.† Carrieanne Mamba / Daily Nexus Christmas Menu for 2020: Appetizers Entr√©es Desserts† Carrieanne Mamba / Daily Nexus If you have ever had American Chinese food, you are probably familiar with the egg roll. It is typically filled with cabbage, carrots, and pork, all wrapped in a thick wheat wrapper. We have egg rolls on most Filipino occasions in addition to its cousin, lumpiang shanghai. Thinner than the egg roll, lumpiang shanghai was brought to the Philippines by Chinese migrants and emphasizes more of a ground meat mixture, which is why I like it better! Both fried rolls are often paired with spiced vinegar (suka), or sweet and sour chili sauce depending on your taste preferences.† Siopao also has Chinese origins. The steamed bun is the Filipinoized version of China's cha siu bao. Siopao features a fluffy flour bun with sweet pork filling inside. I have never made them myself because the dough is a hassle to make, but my Ninang Lina is elite at making siopao. Her version features little hard-boiled egg pieces, so any leftover buns are perfect for handheld breakfasts the next morning.† Carrieanne Mamba / Daily Nexus Moving on to the main course, arroz caldo directly translates to rice soup,ù and is a porridge-like dish that often involves chicken. Though it bears a Spanish name, the dish is reminiscent of congee because it came from Chinese migrants. Arroz caldo (lugaw in some parts of the country) is a comfort food known for using heavy amounts of ginger, sometimes too much, and is topped with scallions and toasted garlic. If you're lucky, your portion will come with half a hard boiled egg. If you're unlucky, you will bite into a zesty piece of ginger thinking that it is chicken and feel instant regret. Proceed with caution.† Filipino cuisine is very meat-heavy. During a regular year when families are able to gather, a popular entr√©e would be an entire roast pig or lechon. Given the pandemic, we have had to downsize a lot of typical Christmas elements. Instead of lechon this year, which can feed fifty to a hundred people, we are having pork belly to feed our family of three. Pork belly is not inherently Filipino, but it does showcase the changes we are having to make given the COVID-19 situation.† Carrieanne Mamba / Daily Nexus Lastly, we obviously have sweet treats to finish off our Christmas feast. Christmas Eve, or Nochebuena to Christianized Filipinos, is commemorated by a feast after mass as the event that brings in the holiday. A typical Nochebuena dessert is Filipino fruit salad. Every family has their own version of the salad with different ingredients, but for the most part, Filipino fruit salad consists of a fruit cocktail and young shredded coconut in condensed milk. I have a love-hate relationship with the dessert because some of the ingredients are good, but others in my opinion, should not be there at all. (Please! No more cheese cubes! Why are they in there?). Buko pandan is a type of fruit salad that is made of slivers of young coconut, pandan jelly, and condensed milk. Its green color comes from pandan, which has a sweet, aromatic, and almost floral-like flavor. If there is more liquid, you can drink the dessert. If there is more green pandan jellies and coconut strips, it can be eaten with a spoon.† Unlike the fruit salad and buko pandan which most Filipinos are familiar with, sinabalu is a local dessert that comes from my parents' hometown, Cagayan Valley, in the northernmost region of the Philippines. It is glutinous rice and coconut milk wrapped inside banana leaves and put inside bamboo tubes to cook slowly on low heat. The result is essentially a rice cake that is mild in flavor and paired with coffee or hot chocolate to end the night. Despite being 8,000 miles away from her country of origin, my mother makes it a point to bring the Christmas she knew and grew up with to America so that I may also partake in the traditions of home. Some things are not the same because we do not have the same resources and ingredients, but we do our best to evoke a Christmas spirit that celebrates our culture and our food.† † Carrieanne Mamba is a first-generation college student and second-generation Filipina American who is respectfully asking all titos and titas to stop putting so much ginger in their dishes.

on-the-menu,Seven Days of Salads,11-Jan-21,12:00 AM,['Bethany Clements'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-11/seven-days-of-salads/,"7 Days of Salads Break out those cozy blankets and steaming mugs of apple cider because the holiday season is here! Between the obligatory Christmas-carol karaoke, the ritualized tree selection and the Hallmark movie marathons (a guilty pleasure in my family), I've definitely fallen victim to more food comas than I'd like to admit. After all, who can resist downing some homemade gingerbread while listening to All I Want for Christmas Is You?ù So, I decided I'd try and mix the inevitable holiday snacking with a few more healthy alternatives this year î specifically, salads! Salads aren't just your stereotypical lettuce-and-ranch combo, and more and more stylish ones are becoming a staple on restaurant menus and Instagram feeds alike. In the last week, I've tried out seven different salad combinations, and there are a few I would definitely add to spruce up my holiday diet. (All of these salads are on a bed of lettuce or mixed greens.) Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Day 1: Ingredients: Review:† The week began with an Italian-inspired salad. I remember practically devouring a side salad I once had with some pizza that was topped with heaping mounds of shredded mozzarella cheese, tomato and black olives. I'd always wanted to recreate the salad at home, and my seven-days-of-salad challenge gave me the perfect opportunity! Though I had to settle for slicing some mozzarella balls, the salad ended up tasting like a new take on an old favorite, which was a promising start to my week! Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Day 2: Ingredients: Review:† For the second salad, I tried to create a harvestù theme! The cranberries and Granny Smith apples were mouthwateringly tangy. Paired with the sweetness of the red and yellow apples and the golden raisins, the flavor perfectly complemented the turkey breast and feta cheese! Adding the chopped pecans and pumpkin seeds added a little crunch to the dish î it was almost like turning Thanksgiving dinner into a salad! Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus DAY 3: Ingredients: Directions for avocado-lime dressing:† Review: I tried for a Southwest-style salad today, and every bite had me closing my eyes and envisioning horse rides into the sunset. The corn, beans, bell pepper and tomato gave the salad a really nice texture, and the sprinkle of lime and lemon juice resulted in an amazing explosion of tart flavor. Drizzled with creamy avocado-lime dressing, the only thing missing from this salad is a Western film marathon! Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Day 4: Ingredients: Review: Today's salad relied more on a crunchy, veggie-heavy ingredient list. With boatloads of broccoli and baby carrots tossed into a bed of lettuce, the addition of chopped nuts and crispy wonton strips gave the salad a rich, nutty flavor. A few slivers of ginger and sesame dressing were the perfect final touches to kick this salad into high gear. Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Day 5: Ingredients: Review: On my fifth day, I attempted to recreate one of my all-time favorite salads. As a seafood-inspired dish, it was originally topped with grilled shrimp, but, to save time and money, I stuck with some ceviche. The mangoes and blueberries were a tangy, tart addition to the salad. With some crunchy tortilla chips and a sprinkle of lime and lemon juice, I decided I didn't even need dressing î the ingredients paired perfectly with each other to create a refreshing, tropical taste.† Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Day 6: Ingredients: Review: I'm always partial to a good fruit salad, so on the sixth day, I made a fruit salad and tossed it in with my bed of greens. After all, salads are one of the best places to experiment with ingredient combinations, so I decided to give it a try. Plus, I could use up the rest of my mangoes, apples and blueberries from the previous salads! Though I wished I had some strawberries, peaches or raspberries to make a more well-rounded array of fruits, the addition of pears and golden raisins was nice as well. The creaminess of the goat cheese and the tart vinaigrette rounded out the salad perfectly î a tangy treat for the taste buds. Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Day 7: Ingredients: Review: For the last day, I decided to stick with a good old chef salad î it took a little more preparation to hard boil the egg, but I personally feel that egg is part of what makes a chef salad so rich and delicious! To counter the fruity salad on day six, this one was chock-full of broccoli, carrots and radish (the radish was a last-minute addition, but it sure spiced up the dish!). The meat, olives and creamy blue cheese dressing were the perfect finishing touches for my last salad of the week. While the holidays are a time to release those societal pressures and treat yourself to a mug of rich, marshmallow-topped hot chocolate, sometimes it's nice to opt for a lighter alternative to the traditional meals. It's a fun and healthy way to spice up your daily diet, not to mention super flexible and personalized! (Share your own go-to salad recipes on Instagram by tagging @ucsbonthemenu!) Plus, salads are a quick fix for any (socially distanced!) family gatherings or potlucks on the calendar for this year. I'll definitely be whipping a few of these up for my holiday meal rotation.

Pickling enables you to keep food that would normally spoil in a few days for up to a month î and sometimes even longer. It's a fantastic way to decrease your food waste, not to mention you get a delicious, salty treat as a reward. While it's completely possible to pickle almost anything î even hard-boiled eggs î this recipe is for the classic pickled cucumber. The only caveat? You'll have to wait at least five days before you can eat this snack¶ but trust me, it's worth the wait. Laura Tucker / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: Yeah, you read that right. There's literally only one step to making these amazing, crunchy pickles. If the pickles and other ingredients are floating to the top of the jar above the vinegar, place a coffee filter and a rock on top of the liquid to hold everything down. If you want to be extra careful in the preparation of these pickles, you can heat the apple cider vinegar to a near boil and let it cool before pouring it over the other ingredients.†

on-the-menu,Holy Matcha: San Diego's First Matcha Cafe,21-Jan-21,8:38 PM,['Nicole Wakeland'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-21/holy-matcha-san-diegos-first-matcha-cafe/,"Within the last few years, matcha has become all the rave. Due to high levels of antioxidants, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, matcha is becoming a healthier and cleaner alternative to coffee. You can now find matcha cafes in every major city in the United States, including San Diego. There are not many other cafes that specialize purely in matcha, which makes Holy Matcha that much more noteworthy. Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus Matcha is a type of green tea made from young tea leaves that are steamed, dried and finely grounded into a bright green powder. Dating back to 12th-century Japan, Zen monks would make bowls of matcha and drink them for lasting energy that would guide them through hours of meditation.† After seeing this ritual at its birthplace, Geraldine Ridaura returned back to her hometown with aspirations to bring matcha to her community. In 2017, she opened San Diego's first matcha cafe ìì Holy Matcha. Since then, Ridaura's small business has received tons of support from locals and visitors stopping by.† As a native San Diegan, I was excited to finally try one of these highly sought-after lattes. The menu includes all types of beverages, from a simple ceremonial cup of matcha to flavored matcha lattes and lemonades. Light bites, like avocado toast and chia pudding, are also available.† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus When entering the cafe, I immediately noticed the inviting and vibrant decor. The walls were light pink with accents of tropical leaf wallpaper, and there were cute marble tables with pink seating. Plants and Holy Matcha merch were also present throughout the cafe. This cafe definitely seemed Instagram worthy.† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about each drink as well as the matcha ritual itself. Upon ordering, I decided to try the latte called the Thai Coconut Matcha, which includes coconut cream, matcha and coconut milk. This drink only comes iced, but there were many other options if I wished for a warm beverage.† Although I had not tried many matcha drinks before, this coconut matcha latte was delicious. The matcha was rich in flavor, with sweet, nutty and vegetal notes. The drink was creamy and had the perfect amount of coconut flavor. It wasn't too overbearing, and all the flavors mixed together harmoniously.† This latte was $6, but other Holy Matcha drinks range from $5.75 to $8. Although this is more on the expensive side, I think it was worth it. Each drink is made with high-quality ingredients, giving it the rich taste everyone loves. After getting the chance to ask Ridaura a couple of questions, I noticed how passionate she was about her business and how knowledgeable she was about matcha. I've known all of its benefits prior to owning my business, which is why I wanted to do so and spread light on such an amazing and ancient ritual,ù Ridaura said. San Diego is plagued by coffee shops, and I needed to create a specialty shop dedicated to matcha only.ù Learning about Ridaura's story and being able to try matcha the right way has led me to grow an appreciation for the ritual and the bright green powder. I know that I will try to seek ways to incorporate matcha into my everyday life, as the health benefits are endless.† If you're ever in San Diego after the pandemic ends, remember to visit at least one of the two Holy Matcha locations and support a small local business!†

on-the-menu,Fluffy Taiwanese Castella Cake,26-Jan-21,10:48 AM,['Christine Tu'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-26/fluffy-taiwanese-castella-cake/,"Ever since that video of jiggly cake cutting, otherwise known as Taiwanese castella cake, went viral, the popularity of the delicious, spongy and, of course, jiggly cake has skyrocketed and so has the number of recipes out there. Unfortunately, most of them measure ingredients by weight (which is pretty inconvenient if you don't own a kitchen scale) or require lots of complicated steps and ingredients. In this recipe, I've simplified all the steps and ingredients down to the basics and converted the measurements (and tested all of them multiple times, of course). If you're craving a healthy dessert that's fun to eat and easy to make, this is perfect for you! Christine Tu / Daily Nexus Ingredients (for 12 slices): Directions: This recipe is great because it's really simple and also easily customizable. You could add flavorings such as chocolate powder or matcha to add a fun twist or even more sugar for a sweeter cake. In addition, you could also choose between serving it hot or cold (both are great). The tradeoff is that once the cake hits cold air, it tends to deflate quickly so if you want to eat it cold, leave it to cool off in the turned-off oven for about 20 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack until room temperature. Overall, this is a really fun and foolproof dessert that is definitely worth a try!

on-the-menu,Five Tips for Meal Prepping,29-Jan-21,12:00 AM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-29/five-tips-for-meal-prepping/,"One of the best joys in my homebody experience during COVID-19 is growing my relationship with food, especially through meal prepping î or as I like to call it, mass producing.ù Kitchen hours are dedicated to expanding my home cooking capabilities and playing with colors, tastes and textures. My patio has been transformed as well î an expanding garden of potted vegetables. I have taken the leap and started a food Instagram, sharing my favorite vegan and vegetarian food experiences.† However, with winter quarter starting, this food adventure will need a new direction, more controlled curation. My housemates came back and the privilege of a hollow fridge is no more. I also don't have much time as a full-time student. Home cooks tend to meal prep to develop beneficial eating habits, reduce cooking time that could be used for other obligations or to decrease waste and water usage. I did it for weekly dinner parties with housemates.† I also did it because I grew up in a giant family with big tables and cupboards of glass tupperware. I remember coming home to the doors and windows wide open and the kitchen was sizzling with life. My mom î in the red apron my sister decorated in elementary school for Mother's Day î had a thousand eyes on a thousand pans. For dinner, a buffet decorated our glass table. Chinese food drowned flowery soup bowls bargained from Chinatown. A rice cooker bathed in the warmù setting. The following mornings and lunches hosted microwaved meals î courtesy of last night.† I do not have the privilege of walking to a nearby grocery store whenever I need the sesame seeds I forgot to buy last time anymore, so I have to remember why I want to mass produce meals and how to do it more effectively. If you are in the same situation, here are several tips to remember when meal prepping.† Emily Liu / Daily Nexus  Practice Planning Ahead The best strategy to appreciate mass producing meals is to plan ahead. Too many leftovers are exhausting and wasteful. I remember creating a cauldron of Japanese curry î eight curry blocks and a full can of coconut milk. Too many mouthfuls. On the other hand, too few meals may cause hunger, unplanned kitchen hours or spontaneous snacking. I may lunge for Grubhub take out too.† Planning ahead may look like scrolling through the social media of influencers for their meal plans or for inspiration. My Instagram home page is often filled with content by @frommybowl, @meowmeix and @the.korean.vegan. Be wary, though. Everyone has different kitchens and goals. If you do not see someone that matches your situation or goals, upload your mass producing progress. Be the inspiration you want to see. You may ask, Where do I start?ù I enjoy checking local grocery stores for sales. Organizing meals around items on sale helps save money. For example, Idaho russet potatoes were on sale at my Albertsons: one 5-pound bag for $1.69. That week, my belly tasted potato curry, gamja salad, tudou si and more. I ensure the ingredients I buy in bulk make an appearance in at least three recipes. Otherwise, I grab only one or two mighty tomatoes and such.† Another tip is to learn about various kitchen machines and equipment that can make cooking faster: blenders, ovens and air fryers. Using numerous of them at a time may also save time, but be careful of a power outage!† †  Listen To Your Body Food is nutrients, but not all nutrients make the best fuel for your body. For example, as someone who is lactose intolerant, I understand the consequences are not worth any dairy-laden boba, ice cream or cheesy pizza. Therefore, my mass producing counter doesn't touch dairy without my consent.† Another food my mind has a toxic relationship with is anything with caffeine. Coffee and tea work a bit too well, turning the thoughts in my mind into ping-pong balls. These caffeine-pressured thoughts often spit out uncensored. For me, these foods are most effective when consumed before a necessary study grind, with the SelfControl app locking chess and social media for certain hours. Therefore, my fridge is a tiramisu virgin and that is okay. On the other hand, my body worships chickpeas. This bean is incredible in chickpea òtuna' sandwiches and curries and keeps me full for hours. No bloating. When there is a sale for chickpeas, I will do a little dance and grab handfuls of cans until the cart drowns. The cashier may give a look, thinking I am building a bunker for the apocalypse. I strut out, a winner regardless. There are also foods that do not taste good. The definition of goodù is relative. When I was young, my nose turned at raw celery î uncomfortable crunchiness and wetness, the hard fibers sticking between teeth, a sickly green color. There may be a reason why your tongue rejects certain foods. A sign of natural defense, perhaps? I have several friends who despise cilantro and I leave it out in a separate bowl for those friends who do want to add cilantro to their curries. There are always numerous foods out there that can replace the ingredients disliked. For example, look up vegan egg substitutions. Some work, some don't. After all, food is an experience.† At the same time, I have come to understand that taste buds change over time. Weakening, I think. Some of my friends grow offended by the amount of sugar in some sweets. We say they have grandpa/grandma tongues. Now, I add celery to simmer in stews. I suggest trying the foods you were once picky about again. Your body might enjoy the food more than you thought, especially if prepared the way you like.† †  Learn From Your Food From the plants growing what you consume to the nutrients that will benefit your body, try to grow in your curiosity and learn more about them.† Learn what foods harmonize together. Fun fact: Ripe tomatoes have high levels of glutamic acid, which offers more umami or savoriness to the meals they are a part of. Some people have discovered strange food combinations that work for them but not for others. Oatmeal and sriracha. Pickles and peanut butter. Pineapple and soy sauce. During these experimental times, make a little portion to taste test before meal prepping.† Learn how foods you tend to buy can last longer in the pantry, in the fridge or in the freezer. Did you know submerging your celery and carrots in water in the fridge makes them last up to two weeks? The entire point of mass producing meals is to stretch out the meals as long as necessary. Stretching out meals is not effective if the food grows molds on the second day because you forgot to refrigerate it.† Learn how your food changes with different cooking methods and for different meals. Steam it. Stir fry it. Roast it. I love raw carrot as ribbons in my salads but would prefer them chopped rangiri style in my curry.† Additionally, if you have the space, time and money, try to grow an edible garden. The transparency of caring for your own garden is important î you can see what you are putting into your body and into your environment. This can bloom into a hobby away from the eye-straining screens or even be your greatest pride when you have visitors. For the scale of mass producing meals, caring for plants that have numerous yields at once like bell peppers or tomatoes may save more money in the long run.† Slowing down to understand the world of food makes this mass producing journey an intimate learning experience.†† † Reduce Waste Consciously The next step is to create a home with a system for reusing food scraps. Freeze your veggie scraps î carrot leaves, cauliflower stems and potato peels î to turn into stock. Soak banana peels in water overnight to use as fertilizer. Turn the food scraps into compost to give back to the plants that made the food you consume. Freeze chopped herb leftovers with olive oil or butter to be used at a moment's notice.† Not only will you get more bang out of your buck by finding numerous purposes for your food, you can also incorporate these tips to spice up or stretch your everyday pantry items.† † Grow Wealthy With Kindred Spirit(s) At least once a week, my housemates and I host a dinner party or a fun brunch. We talk about what we have and what we crave. Then, we gather and feast. The night ends when someone pardons themselves for tomorrow's early obligations.† Home-cooked feasts are another easy way for busy people to meal prep, too. Our fridges host glass containers of leftovers. Building community through food is an easy way for busy people to gather. To make mass producing meals more of an adventure, my friends and I enjoy an activity before î to grow an appetite î or afterward î to digest the food. A movie marathon. A tennis rally. One time, we painted with watercolors.† In addition to social enjoyment, cooking with kindred spirits builds skills that can be applicable to meal prepping by yourself. Let your friends take the head chef hat. It is an opportunity to try new cuisine, try new chopping methods and try new cultural cooking habits. For example, I enjoy cutting my carrots into angular cubes but learned that discs were more fun to add to curries and carrot ribbons were more exciting in salads.† Kitchen hours with kindred spirits may change your life as well. I hope you are inspired to start mass producing meals soon!

As always, spices and flavoring can be adjusted to your individual tastes. These prices are based on Trader Joe's products and may not reflect the prices in other stores. When calculating the cost of the main ingredients, I excluded pantry staples including spices and olive oil. However, these ingredients are still cheap to purchase, last a long time and are handy staples to keep in stock in your pantry for many other dishes. If you'd like a starchy side, I recommend making a batch of orzo, quinoa or roasted potatoes. Recipe adapted from The Mediterranean Dish.

on-the-menu,Claire Saffitz's Dessert Personù: Putting Three Recipes to the Test,5-Feb-21,11:55 AM,['Michelle Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-05/claire-saffitzs-dessert-person-putting-three-recipes-to-the-test/,"Over winter break, I was gifted a copy of Dessert Person: Recipes and Guidance for Baking with Confidence,ù a cookbook by the one and only Claire Saffitz. Like many others, I was first introduced to Saffitz through the Youtube series Gourmet Makes. In the show, Saffitz, a French-trained pastry chef, would be tasked with recreating a famous treat î think Twinkies, Hot Pockets, Twix, Ruffles î with a gourmet twist. Along with her dry humor and Type-A personality, Saffitz was also known for her ability to break down even the most complex recipes and reinterpret them in a modern way.† Dessert Personù is the embodiment of Saffitz's personality. The book itself has over 100 recipes, mostly desserts, with the exception of a savory baking section that has been given a modern twist. Each recipe is ranked on a scale of 1-5 for difficulty (1 being òvery easy' and 5 being òvery difficult'), along with a time estimate, allergen notices and even a season category that takes into account the recipe's seasonal produce.† As someone who loves to bake but is definitely not an expert, I was especially intrigued by the difficulty measures for each recipe. I thought it would be a fun idea to make one recipe for three out of the five difficulty levels (excluding level 1 because I wanted a challenge and excluding level 5 because they were too much of a challenge) and see, from a home baker's perspective, if each recipe is as easy or difficult as the book claims. And of course, I wanted to see if the recipes tasted as good as they looked in the pictures.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Brown Butter and Sage Sabl√© Cookies (Level 2: Easy) The first recipe I attempted was the Brown Butter and Sage Sabl√© Cookies. Labeled as a level 2 recipe, I felt pretty confident going into it, especially since most cookie recipes I've made are pretty straightforward.† However, my confidence quickly dwindled as I messed up on the very first step of the recipe, which was to make the sage brown butter. The recipe instructs to heat up two sticks of butter with four sprigs of sage in a small saucepan until it boils, and keep cooking until brown bits appear. I turned away from the stove for like a minute to measure out the dry ingredients and came back to a pot full of black liquid with a very bitter smell. Pro tip: Keep your eyes on your brown butter so it doesn't burn and stink up your whole house.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus After the brown butter fiasco, the rest of the recipe went pretty smoothly. I creamed the brown butter with the sugar and combined it with the dry ingredients. The recipe called for cornstarch, but I didn't have any so I subbed with sweet potato starch powder, which seemed to work fine. The most technical aspect of this recipe was forming the cookie dough into logs using parchment paper, in order to cut the cookies into uniform circles. However, the book gave a great step-by-step on how to form the logs, along with visuals, so this step ended up being easier than I expected. Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus I followed the recipe's instructions to chill the logs for at least two hours, rolled each log in turbinado sugar (recipe calls for demerara sugar, a coarser kind of raw sugar), cut them into half-inch slices and popped them into the oven. The book emphasizes that cook times are suggestions, not dogma,ù so I followed the recipe's tip to take the cookies out when the edges are golden, which took around 18 minutes (out of the proposed 16-20 minutes).† My family and I ate the cookies straight out of the oven, and we were pleasantly surprised. I was a bit worried about incorporating such a strong flavor like sage, but it added a unique savoriness to the cookie that tasted so good with the nuttiness of the brown butter. The texture of the cookie was crunchy but light at the same time, crumbling in your mouth as soon as you bit into it.† Difficulty: 2 / 5 I think the proposed difficulty level is accurate. Once I got the brown butter down, it was just a matter of combining wet and dry ingredients and forming the dough. Having to wait 2 hours for the dough to chill was a small inconvenience, but nothing major.† Taste: 4.5 / 5 The sage really elevated the flavor of the cookie, and the cookie texture was amazing. I'm taking off half a point though because I think you really have to like sage to like this cookie. After eating it for a bit, the sage flavor does get a little overpowering. I'm curious to remake this recipe without the sage and see if it tastes even better.† † Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Flourless Chocolate Wave Cake (Level 3: Moderate) The following week, I decided to make the Flourless Chocolate Wave Cake, a lighter take on a traditional flourless chocolate cake. The cake has that wow-factor look, as the edges of the cake form a pretty wave pattern that I've never seen before in a cake.† Unlike the previous recipe, which didn't require any special equipment, this recipe calls for a 9-inch springform pan. I considered just using a regular cake pan, but I ended up buying a springform pan because I didn't want to risk ruining the wavy edges of the cake (a springform has removable sides so it's easy to take the cake out of the pan). After getting the appropriate equipment, I got started on the actual recipe. I melted the chocolate, oil, dark whiskey and water together over a double boiler, and combined it with an egg yolk and almond flour mixture.† To make the cake less dense than a traditional flourless chocolate cake, the recipe calls for meringue (whipped egg whites) to be added to the cake batter. Making the meringue was a whole other process, taking around 10 minutes of beating the egg whites to reach the desired level of stiffness and glossiness. At around the five-minute mark, I realized I probably should have used a bigger bowl. Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Once the meringue was done, I carefully folded it into the almond-flour batter, poured the whole mixture into the springform pan, and sprinkled the top with white sugar. In the oven, the cake rose dramatically, almost like a souffle, which was pretty cool to see. After it was out of the oven and cooled down, the cake sank down and formed the wave pattern around the edges î just like in the picture! The cake itself was just like how I imagined it to be. It had a deep chocolate flavor and soft, mousse-like texture that reminded me of a Japanese-style cheesecake. It was also on the less sweet side, unlike other flourless chocolate cakes I've tried. Difficulty: 2 / 5 While the book rates this recipe a 3 out of 5 in difficulty, I honestly think it was just as easy to make as the sabl√© cookies. Making the meringue was the most time-consuming element of this recipe, but the book gave very clear instructions on how to make it and how to tell when your meringue is ready.† Taste: 3.5 / 5† This cake was definitely good, but there wasn't anything mind-blowing or special about it aside from the wavy edges. Taking away the visual appeal though, the cake tastes like a standard chocolate cake, just a little more fluffy and less sweet. I'm not sure if I'd make it again for fun, but I'd eat it again if someone else made it for me.† † Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Black Sesame Paris Brest (Level 4: Difficult) For the third and final recipe, I decided to try making the Black Sesame Paris-Brest. Black sesame is a flavor I grew up eating in Asian desserts, so I was curious to see how it would taste in the form of a Paris Brest, a classic French pastry named after the famous Paris-Brest bicycle race.† There are three parts to making this recipe, the first being to make the black sesame pastry cream, which is a separate recipe in the book. I've never made pastry cream before, so I was surprised by how technical the whole process is, like having to temper the egg yolk mixture before adding it to the pot of milk and heating the mixture just enough to activate the cornstarch, but not too much so as to burn pastry cream.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus I fully expected myself to mess up in some way, but the pastry cream actually turned out delicious! I tasted the cream on its own before adding the black tahini (black sesame paste), and it was so creamy and custardy that I almost didn't want to add the tahini for fear of ruining it.† I added it though for the sake of the recipe and popped the pastry cream into the fridge to chill for four hours.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus About an hour before the pastry cream was ready, I started the next part of the recipe, which was to make the p√¢te √† choux for the pastry shell. Making the p√¢te √† choux was the part I was most nervous about because I've tried making it before to make cream puffs, and it was a complete fail î the cream puffs did not puff up at all.† What's unique about a p√¢te √† choux dough is that you precook the dough on the stove and add in a bunch of eggs afterward (this recipe called for five) so that the dough puffs up in the oven. The recipe states to keep cooking the dough until a light film forms on the bottom and sides of the pan. After taking the dough off the stove, I transferred it into my family's super old stand mixer (I think it's literally older than me) and beat in five eggs, one at a time, until the paddle, when pulled up, forms a V-shaped dough trail. I then piped the dough into three overlapping circles to form the ring.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus I brushed on the egg wash and sprinkled on turbinado sugar and white sesame seeds (didn't have black sesame seeds, oops) and put it in the oven. Baking the p√¢te √† choux was a task in and of itself because you have to lower the oven temperature after 10 minutes, monitor the pastry so that it dries out enough but doesn't overcook and let the pastry cool with the oven door propped open so that it doesn't crack. My p√¢te √† choux ring ended up being a mixed-success î part of it puffed up, but other parts stayed pretty flat. I have a feeling it might be because of the uneven temperature in my oven but who knows.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Once cooled, I cut off the top of the ring and piped in the black sesame pastry cream and whipped cream, which I made while the p√¢te √† choux was baking. Because the pastry was flatter than expected, the final product didn't turn out exactly like the picture in the book, but I think it came pretty close.† Difficulty: 5 / 5† This recipe was definitely a challenge to make, mostly because there were so many technical components and a lot of observation and waiting involved. I think the p√¢te √† choux alone adds another point of difficulty to this recipe. Taste: 5 / 5† Even though this recipe was by far the hardest to make, I would definitely make it again for a special occasion or just a treat for myself because it was just that good. The p√¢te √† choux dough was the perfect blank canvas for the sweet whipped cream and black sesame pastry cream, which was the real star of the dish.† † Overall, Dessert Personù is a cookbook that has recipes for bakers of all levels. I would especially recommend this book for people who want to spice up their desserts while still eating something familiar to them.†

With the pandemic limiting food options to mostly take-out, it can be hard to find a nice place to sit down for sweets with your loved one. Luckily, a restaurant has recently popped up in Santa Barbara that specializes not only in take-out dessert, but now also offers Valentine's Day-themed treats.† Insomnia Cookies, located at 430 State Street, has now added two Valentine's Day themed cookies to their menu: chocolate covered strawberry and red velvet. Being rather ambivalent to red velvet in general, I decided to try out their chocolate covered strawberry. And wow, that cookie is not soon to be forgotten!†The ordering process was incredibly straightforward and, surprisingly, they delivered to Goleta. It is rare to see restaurants on State Street offer delivery at the student apartments, so that was a nice change. The wait for the cookies, however, was less than ideal. Waiting over an hour and forty-five minutes for a few cookies was pushing it a bit. However, when they arrived, I knew that this was a good call.† I was pleasantly surprised that the cookies were still warm on arrival even after such a long wait to get here. Upon the first bite, the cookie exploded with the sour, citric acid taste from the strawberry bits. It then moved to the rich taste of the large, dark chocolate chunks. Finally, the warm, buttery sweet taste of the sugar cookie ended the perfect bite that made you want to go back for more.† The only problem I had with the cookie is that it ended too quickly. This was the perfect treat to enjoy at home alone. I can't help but think, however, how great the cookie would be warmed up and served with vanilla ice cream to be shared with a loved one.† If you are in a pinch this Valentine's Day and want a simple treat that can be delivered right to your door, check out the Valentine's Day options at Insomnia Cookies.

on-the-menu,Doughnutù Miss Out on the Goodies at God's Country Provisions,18-Feb-21,4:51 PM,['Jill Ridens'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-18/doughnut-miss-out-on-the-goodies-at-gods-country-provisions/,"Just 35 minutes north of UC Santa Barbara is Buellton î a small, sleepy city famously nicknamed Home of Split Pea Soup.ù Buellton is located in the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley, with rolling hills, big ranches and friendly people. Some refer to this space in California as God's Countryù; for the Ollenburger and Minus families, the Santa Ynez Valley was just that. Since 2018, they have owned God's Country Provisions,ù a popular local doughnut shop. Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus The shop is small, quaint and aesthetically pleasing. Subway tiles line the walls, and a beautiful glass case displays the many different doughnut options. Their menu does not disappoint! It consists of cake doughnuts, raised doughnuts, old-fashioned doughnuts, filled doughnuts, fritters and other specialties. They even have gluten-free doughnuts for those with dietary restrictions! I was so surprised to see the variety of flavors as well, with a range of classic doughnuts to fun holiday-edition ones. My roommates and I made a fun road trip out of visiting this shop; it was a beautiful drive up the 101 to enjoy yummy treats! Unsurprisingly, a few other groups had the same doughnut plan, but the service was speedy and personable. We purchased the dark-chocolate orange, crumb, apple cider, glazed, chocolate-glazed and gluten-free options. Our personal favorites were the crumb and dark-chocolate orange!

I've always been fascinated with this kind of pseudo-alchemy, mixing different ingredients together to create something entirely original. Now that I'm 21, I've moved on to creating more ¶ digestible elixirs: cocktails. When I have the time, I love mixing complicated drinks that feel more or less like I'm that 5-year-old kid creating some kind of potion. Only, a 5-year-old who's about to get a buzz going. This blackberry-jalape√±o margarita fits that bill, and the end product is far more delicious than any dirt-and-grass drink I made when I was 5.† While most margaritas use tequila as their base, this one uses mezcal, a spirit mainly produced in Oaxaca, Mexico. Both tequila and mezcal are made by fermenting the hearts of the agave plant in water. However, in the production of mezcal, the agave undergoes an extra step before fermentation: cooking. The agave hearts are baked for days in pits dug in the ground, similar to the process used for barbacoa. This extra step gives the end product a delicious smoky flavor that, in my opinion, puts it a step above tequila.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Ingredients: For the blackberry-jalape√±o syrup: For the margarita: Directions:† For the blackberry-jalape√±o syrup: For the margarita: If you've never tried mezcal, I think this drink will blow you away.

on-the-menu,Halo Top Ice Cream Review,25-Feb-21,12:04 AM,['Charlotte Glass'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-25/halo-top-ice-cream-review/,"For those who battle severe ice cream cravings and/or lactose intolerance, I advise you to read the following article. The health food revolution of the past decade has created a new and thriving market for alternative forms of everyone's favorite dessert: ice cream. In fact, the variety of brands, milk derivatives, supplements and flavors that line grocery store freezer sections can appear rather overwhelming to a shopper. Despite the abundance of ice cream options, Halo Top, founded in 2012, has prevailed as the dominant ice cream alternative. In fact, the brand managed to beat out long-established companies such as Ben & Jerry's and H√§agen-Dazs as the No.1 selling pint of ice cream in the U.S in 2017. Clearly, Halo Top has become a cult favorite. The company offers 25 different flavors comprised of dairy, non-dairy and keto options, each of which contains less sugar, fewer calories and greater protein than your traditional pint. Last year the company even dropped a popsicle line.† Now, I can get behind the move towards healthy ice cream. I do, however, feel the need to note that I'm using the term healthyù very lightly. Ice creams advertised as healthy alternatives are, in fact, ice cream î they still contain great quantities of sugar, milk, artificial flavorings and all sorts of chemicals that probably aren't so great for the human body. That being said, companies like Halo Top seek to make your ice cream addiction a bit less detrimental to your health.†††† Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus Here's my quick take of some of Halo Tops' most intriguing delights. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (5/10) An age-old classic, chocolate chip cookie dough elicits a lot of expectations and, accordingly, opinions from ice cream connoisseurs. Unfortunately, I think cookie dough lovers would be unmoved by this flavor. More than other pints, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough reveals that Halo Top is not regular ice cream. Of course, one should not expect Halo Top to taste exactly like regular ice cream as it possesses its own flavor profile. But a subpar vanilla base dominates this pint as measly morsels of cookie dough get lost in a cloud of mediocrity.† Peanut Butter Cup (10/10) Now this. Is. Something. Special. Thick dollops of flavorful peanut butter complement a sweet, creamy base in a swirl of pure goodness. Even to those who wouldn't consider themselves peanut butter fanatics, rest assured, you will be satisfied by this pint. Peanut Butter Cup is certainly the richest of the Halo Top flavors I've sampled and, by virtue of that, bears the greatest resemblance to traditional ice cream. This flavor is definitely a crowd pleaser.† Mint Chip (10/10) In one word: perfect. Full disclosure, I'm partial to this flavor (it's my personal favorite), but it's also objectively really well done î I could not ask for more in a mint chip ice cream. Crisp, sweet, light, refreshing, the ice cream itself provides quite a delight. Furthermore, the chocolate chunks are just the right level of sweetness so that they complement, rather than overpower, each bite. If you're a mint chip lover, this is î without a doubt î the Halo Top pint for you.† Strawberry (4/10) Unless you absolutely love strawberry ice cream (the type of love that you would never even think to get another flavor), I wouldn't recommend this pint. The level of creaminess and sweetness were ok, but the artificial strawberry flavoring brought this pint down in my book. To be blunt, this tasted like a diluted strawberry Starburst ice cream (if that's a thing, anyway). Personally, I like strawberry ice cream to taste like actual strawberries. This just isn't something I'd spend money on.† Dairy-Free Peanut Butter Cup (10/10) Just when I thought Halo Top's regular Peanut Butter Cup could not be matched, this pint proved me wrong. The brand uses coconut milk for all of their dairy-free desserts, which, in the case of Peanut Butter Cup, contributed marvelously to the flavor profile. In comparison to the regular Peanut Butter Cup, this pint contained a sweeter, softer base ice cream that served as an even more harmonious match to intermittent globs of salty peanut butter. Although both pints are superb, I would pick the non-dairy version of this flavor in a heartbeat.†† All in all, I definitely recommend trying out Halo Top. I generally found it to be pretty hit or miss, but you're sure to find your perfect pint with such a variety of flavors and dietary options. Who knows, maybe you'll find yourself reaching for a pint of Peanut Butter Cup instead of your trusty Phish Food.† Obviously, alternative ice creams have come to stay. The real question is whether or not traditional ice creams will fade away. A version of this article appeared on pg.12 of the February 25 print edition of the†Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Caj√©'s Honey-Lavender Latte: An Artisanal Delight Right in Your Backyard,2-Mar-21,12:00 AM,['Charlotte Glass'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-02/cajes-honey-lavender-latte-an-artisanal-delight-right-in-your-backyard/,"Charlotte Glass / Daily Nexus What better way to start off your morning than with a crisp, sweet cup of hyper-caffeinated goodness? While the name alone sounds decadent enough, Caj√©'s honey-lavender latte delivers a taste that even the most seasoned coffee connoisseurs would approve of. I, an avid latte consumer, was utterly wowed by Caj√©'s creation.† When I first sipped this latte, my taste buds registered the familiar taste of coffee, but then all of the sudden there was this twist î a woody, almost minty flavor took over. It actually took me a second to remember what I was drinking and realize that this was the lavender kicking in. Once recognized, though, the lavender presented a pleasant surprise that kept my taste buds wanting more. Refreshing, herbal and almost detoxifying, it provided the perfect accompaniment to the candied taste of honey. Honey provides the ideal sweetener to this latte as it possesses a distinct flavor that reins the lavender in î agave or sugar would likely just dilute the herb's potency and make it appear out of place alongside the coffee. After all, honey and lavender are an iconic culinary duo.† The quality of these two keynote ingredients, both organic and locally farmed, made itself undoubtedly apparent. Higher-quality honey is always recognizable because of its sharper flavor î it's not just sweet and sugary but also has a unique kind of syrupy flavor to it. The farmed lavender, earthy yet not overdone (as typically seen in chemically-derived lavender products), also shined. I'm a staunch believer that higher-quality ingredients always yield a higher-quality product î a credo definitely apparent in this latte. And, on top of all of that, I have yet to mention the most magical aspect of this drink: no bad coffee aftertaste! The combination of lavender and honey completely derides drinkers of that sometimes unsavory aftertaste that coffee beans harbor. As I already said, magical.† Now, if you have an extreme aversion to lavender (maybe it reminds you too much of laundry detergent or soap or whatever), then this latte is, unfortunately, not for you. However, if you're a little more on the cusp about lavender, I think a good indicator would be whether or not you like mint coffee; lavender is just kind of taking coffee in a different herbal direction, so if you like mint coffee, I would recommend that you try out this latte. I myself tend to have a love-hate relationship with lavender, but I thought Caj√© utilized it really well, especially by pairing it with honey. If you're a big lavender lover, this latte will easily win you over. Regardless, I would encourage any coffee drinker to try it out î how else will you build your coffee knowledge base without going artisanal?†

on-the-menu,Hearty Chickpea Salad,4-Mar-21,12:00 AM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-04/hearty-chickpea-salad/,"Two years ago, I discovered one of the most amazing staples in plant-based cooking: chickpeas. Also known as garbanzo beans, these beans are extremely versatile. They're tasty in curries, when roasted or when used in salads. Even the liquid from the chickpeas î called aquafaba î is famous in vegan baking for creating fluffy meringues and cakes. Similar to an egg, potato or tuna salad, garbanzo beans have the creaminess to be the star of their own salad.† During midterms, I meal-prepped this chickpea salad for numerous tasty and filling brunch meals. Perfect to whip up for a well-rounded munch between Zoom meetings, I usually slap some on toast with tea and stir-fry on the side and call it a quick meal. Some people also use chickpea salad as a dip for tortilla chips, Triscuits, Snack Factory's pretzel crisps, etc. This dish is extremely filling due to its high protein content (19g of protein in 100g of chickpeas) and lasts in the fridge for a long time.

on-the-menu,"Recycling, Reviving and Repairing Foods",6-Mar-21,3:58 PM,['Maya Salem'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-06/recycling-reviving-and-repairing-foods/,"The three R's î reduce, reuse, recycle î don't only apply to plastic bottles and textiles. Wasting less food not only saves money but also reduces our carbon footprint. When we throw out food, we waste the water and resources required to produce, transport and package it. Then, as it fills up landfills, it produces methane, a long-lasting greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, further contributing to climate change. So before you toss out your stale bread or old berries, try some of these tips to revive or recycle them. Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Avocados Darkened guacamole is a huge disappointment. Fear not, however, because there are a few tricks you can take to save your exposed avocado from oxidation. The browning that appears when avocado flesh is exposed to the air is the same chemical process that darkens apples and bananas. Enzymes in the fruit react with oxygen in the air, which converts them into another type of enzyme compound that manifests as a brown pigmentation to the avocado flesh. It is a defense mechanism for the fruit to ward off bacteria in order to slow the rotting process.† The first course of action to take if you are not using the whole avocado is to keep the pit in place! The pit is large and heavy enough to keep at least some of the leftover avocado from darkening. However, the exposed areas of the avocado will begin to start the enzymatic browning reaction. So, try to cover the rest of the avocado as best you can.† Next, there are several theories surrounding the best way to keep guacamole green. Some suggest having a layer of acid sit atop the guacamole in a sealed container. Some chefs like to put a layer of water on top, as this also would block oxygen from reaching the delicate flesh. Of course, when it comes time to eat the guacamole, simply drain off the water. It's a strange method, but it tastes the same. My foolproof way is a combination of these tactics î for which I must give credit to my father. Inside a sealed container, spread a thin layer of acid (typically lime juice) atop the guacamole and cover it with plastic wrap. † Stale Bread A hardened loaf of bread is almost equally as depressing. But, again, there is a quick fix for this.† Dampen a towel with warm water and wrap it around your loaf of bread. Place the swaddled bread on a baking sheet or heat-safe dish. You can pop this in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 F or in the microwave for 10 seconds. Though this method truly revives stale bread, I would not suggest doing it more than once. Of course, another use for stale bread is croutons or fresh bread crumbs. Toast or bake the sliced bread as needed. Then, process the bread in a food processor or simply break it up with your fingers. I also suggest adding a few spices to your bread crumbs or croutons while they are still warm, such as paprika or cayenne pepper. † Hard Cookies and Clumped Brown Sugar If your cookies have gotten hard or a little stale, a quick fix is to store them in an airtight container with something from which they can absorb moisture. A glass of water does nicely, as does a slice of fresh bread.† This method also works wonders for clumped, hard brown sugar. If not stored in an airtight container, brown sugar loses moisture very easily. But, when stored with a slice of bread, it is quickly rejuvenated. Of course, hardened cookies can also make for a delicious, crumbly topping for ice cream, or your dessert of choice. Depending on how hard your cookies are, you may need to use a meat tenderizer or hammer to break them apart.† † Crystallized Honey If you have 100% pure honey, it will harden and crystallize over time due to its naturally occurring properties. The pollen present in genuine honey catalyzes the binding of glucose to fructose and the substance begins to crystallize. While this is completely safe to eat, in order to restore your honey to its drizzling state, try giving it a bath in hot water. Simply fill a bowl with warm water and place your honey jar inside. The sugar crystals should quickly begin to fade.† † Burns Burning food is never fun for a chef, and it is also very rarely done discreetly î the smell, the smoke and the fire alarm will make sure everybody knows of your mistake. Sometimes, however, there is some salvaging possible.† First, try to move the food into a new pot so that it stops cooking. The reason being is that even if you turn off the heat, chances are î as cookware is made with highly conductive materials î the pan is likely still emitting heat. In the new pot, drape a damp towel over the food and let it sit for a few minutes. The goal is to rehydrate the food. A quick tip for burnt toast is to rub the darkened pieces against each other in order to remove the burnt parts. Though there might still be a slightly burnt taste to the toast, depending on the bread type, you won't be eating the darkened bits.† However, not all mistakes are fatal. There will be times that the food can actually be served as is. For example, scorched rice can be particularly tasty, and it is a cuisine that is enjoyed around the world. In China, scorched rice is called gu≈çbƒÅ, and it is a commonly used ingredient in Sichuan cuisine as it can take on the flavors of rich soups. Likewise, in Iraq, hikakeh is a scorched rice dish that's served overturned onto a plate so that everyone can have a piece of scorched rice with fluffy rice on the inside. When revival is not an option, here are some delicious tips on how to reuse and recycle produce! † Sour milk Disclaimer: This method only applies to non-ultra pasteurized milks (such as fa!rlife or Horizon Organic). There is an important difference between sour milk and spoiled milk. As long as the milk is not past its expiration date, it is safe to assume that the milk has naturally begun to ferment and sour.† Sour milk can serve as a substitute or helpful addition to a multitude of foods. You can use sour milk as a replacement for buttermilk, yogurt or sour cream. Buttermilk pancakes or waffles taste just the same as those with sour milk. You can also dilute the milk with water and pour it onto plant beds. Its calcium-rich qualities should be beneficial to plants, especially tomato plants. Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Berries Berries are some of the most versatile foods when it comes to recycling options î the first of which is freezing them. If you know you won't be able to eat them all, try freezing them to thaw later or to add to smoothies and ice cream.† My favorite method for reusing my berries is to make fresh jam. Fruits have naturally occurring pectin, a thickening structural acid that gives jelly and jam their jelled texture. In general, you will need about º ì Öî cup of sugar for each pound of fruit (this is also about 1-2 tablespoons of sugar per 1 cup of fruit). Let the berries sit in the sugar for a few hours, up to overnight.† After letting them rest, mash them up a bit before bringing them to a boil in a saucepan. At this point, add about a tablespoon of an acid of your choice î lemon, lime, grapefruit, vinegar, etc. î and reduce the heat to let it simmer.† Make sure to taste the fruit along the way and add sugar or acid as necessary. The acid will help to activate the pectin, and after it simmers for several minutes, you should notice it thickening. This process should not take more than 10 or 15 minutes for a small batch of jam. Pour your jam into a jar or container and let it come to room temperature before refrigerating it. It will stay good for about a month in the fridge.† Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Bananas Bananas are almost as versatile as berries î perhaps because they are also a type of botany berry. They can be used as replacements for dairy or to thicken oatmeal. Bananas can also be frozen for a great addition to a smoothie.† Or, if a trip to obtain some Gone Bananas! from Trader Joe's seems like too much work, you can recreate them with only three ingredients: bananas, chocolate and coconut oil.† First, slice the bananas and let them chill in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. Mix together melted chocolate and coconut oil (approximately 1 tablespoon of oil per cup of chocolate chips). Drizzle î don't dip î the chocolate atop the bananas and let them rest in the freezer until solid.† Fatty acids like coconut oil have a higher melting temperature than those of most other foods, causing coconut oil to be solid at room temperature (around 68 degrees F). When melted, it helps to thin the chocolate for prime chocolate-on-banana coverage. Most importantly, however, when the warmed oil touches the chilled bananas, it immediately begins to harden, creating a chocolate shell.† † Save the climate, spare your wallet and treat your taste buds. It's a win-win-win situation. Send your success stories to @ucsbonthemenu on Instagram.

on-the-menu,A Day of Eating in Solvang,9-Mar-21,12:00 AM,['Michelle Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-09/a-day-of-eating-in-solvang/,"Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Over Presidents' Day weekend, I travelled up to Solvang, CA to celebrate Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and take a break from the hell better known as midterm szn.ù Only a 40-minute drive away from UC Santa Barbara, Solvang is a quaint village known for its Danish-style architecture and wide variety of mom-and-pop restaurants and shops, all within walking distance of each other.† In addition to getting sucked into buying a bunch of things I probably don't need (i.e. clog magnets, Danish dough whisk, boot-shaped shot glass), I visited a decent amount of dining establishments, some better than others. Here's a quick recap of my food adventure in Solvang! † 9 a.m.: Breakfast at Solvang Restaurant Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus We got breakfast at Solvang Restaurant, a place that is famous for their aebleskivers, a traditional Danish snack that resembles a doughnut hole. My boyfriend and I shared one order of the aebleskivers (3 for $4.40), the California Eggs Benedict ($12.50) and the Danish Sausage Plate ($11.50).† The California Eggs Benedict consisted of two English muffins topped with a slice of tomato, a poached egg and hollandaise sauce; the dish also came with a side of sliced avocado and shredded hash browns. I thought it was a solid dish, the hollandaise sauce easily being one of the best I've ever tried in an eggs benedict. However, the Danish Sausage Plate was a little lackluster. The plate came with two pieces of toast, two fried eggs, hash browns and, to our surprise, only one sausage. While there was nothing wrong with the dish from a flavor standpoint, it was disappointing to see that the star of the dish, the sausage, seemed almost like an afterthought.† After finishing our entrees, we moved on to the main reason we wanted to try this restaurant î the aebleskivers. Cooked in a special cast-iron mold, aebleskivers are essentially spheres of dough that are dusted with powdered sugar and served with a side of raspberry sauce. The dough was a lot denser than I thought it would be, having a pancake-like texture. The dough itself also didn't have much flavor, serving instead as a vessel for the sweet-and-tangy raspberry sauce. Overall, the aebleskivers were pretty good, but I would definitely share an order with at least one other person because they were surprisingly very filling.† † 12 p.m.: Pastries at Mortensen's Danish Bakery Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus While walking and browsing different shops, I noticed a super long line of people waiting outside a place called Mortensen's. Naturally, I thought that since there were a lot of people, the place had to be amazing. I made a mental note and came back around 12 p.m. when the line was shorter. Walking into Mortensen's, I was surprised by their wide range of pastries, some of the most notable being danishes in what seemed to be every possible flavor: eclairs, strudels, turnovers and Danish waffles. I ended up getting an apricot danish, raspberry danish, pistachio bar, apple turnover and Danish waffle. While most of the pastries were for family, I tried some of the raspberry danish and the Danish waffle, both of which were flaky, buttery and everything a pastry should be. The Danish waffle in particular, a long, sugar-coated pastry shell that's piped with buttercream and raspberry jam, was especially memorable. However, I will say that it was pretty sweet, so if you're not a fan of super sweet things, I would get something else.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus In short, Mortensen's is definitely the go-to place for pastries. With such a large selection of desserts, you're bound to find something that piques your taste buds.† † 3 p.m.: Lunch at Succulent Cafe After shopping around a bit more, we went to Succulent Cafe to grab a late lunch after seeing that it was one of the more highly rated restaurants on Yelp. The place was super busy, being that it was Valentine's Day and Presidents' Day weekend, so we opted to get takeout instead of doing outdoor dining. I got the Spicy Fried Chicken Salad ($15), while my boyfriend got the Short Rib Hash n' Eggs ($17), an option on their breakfast menu that was also available as part of their late brunch menu. The Spicy Fried Chicken Salad was described as a bed of mixed greens topped with a spicy fried chicken breast, dried cranberries, pepitas and biscuit garlic croutons, served with a side of buttermilk-ranch dressing. The menu made the dish sound amazing, so I was a bit shocked when I opened up my to-go box to find what looked like a reheated frozen chicken cutlet and stale croutons on top of a pile of lifeless greens. To give you a better idea of how bad the dish was, my favorite part of the salad was the dried cranberries. I tried some of my boyfriend's Short Rib Hash n' Eggs though, and I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the meat was and how crispy the potatoes were. But a major caveat in the dish was that the poached eggs were overcooked, and what I expected to be golden, runny yolks instead took on a dry, chalky texture.† † 8:30 p.m.: Dinner at Osteria Grappolo† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus To end the day off, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Osteria Grappolo, a local Italian place. Failing to make a reservation earlier in the day, we walked over to the restaurant at around 6 p.m. to place our name on the walk-in list. The hostess told us that it would be an hour-and-a-half to two-hour wait, which we begrudgingly agreed to, since the other restaurants in the area looked just as busy, and nothing sounded better at the time than a steamy bowl of buttery carbs. We ended up having to wait almost two-and-a-half hours to get seated.† Once seated, we ordered almost immediately. We ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara ($20), spaghetti pasta coated in a parmesan and egg-yolk based sauce and speckled with bits of pancetta, and the Linguine al Pesce ($25), linguine pasta topped with shrimp, salmon, calamari, clams and mussels stewed in tomato sauce.† While we were waiting for our entrees, the waiter brought out a complimentary basket of bread. Even though I'm a sucker for free food, I couldn't bring myself to eat more than one bite of the bread because it was so cold and stale. It became even harder to eat the bread when we poured out a bit of olive oil to dip the bread into and were greeted by a dead fly (or mosquito?) that was trapped inside the oil bottle. Management immediately brought over a new bottle of oil and balsamic vinegar, but at that point, the damage had already been done.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus As my expectations for the place were dangerously waning, the pastas came out and pulled the ultimate Uno reverse card. The carbonara was rich and creamy, the fried bits of pancetta giving off the perfect amount of saltiness. On the other hand, the Linguine al Pesce was a fresher take on pasta, the bright tomato sauce being perfectly complemented by the brininess of the seafood.† Although I will never wait over two hours for a meal again, this place is worth checking out if you're in the area and are craving some good Italian food î just make sure to make a reservation ahead of time and check the oil and vinegar bottles for any uninvited guests.† ì Needless to say, by the end of the day I was completely stuffed. The restaurants I mentioned are just a handful of food establishments located throughout the town. While walking around, I noticed a plethora of other restaurants, from a pho place, to a taco bar, to artisanal grilled cheese stands. If you ever want to go on a quick food adventure, Solvang is the place to go! Comments are closed.

Caj√©, an I.V. classic, has extended its location outside of I.V.. Caj√© in I.V. is known for its 1970s vibes: the cool artwork on the building, its classic coffee options, bagels and acai bowls. However, its new location on State Street could not be more different.†† Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus The Caj√© State Street location opened in November of 2020, peak pandemic, and its COVID-safe layout provides a fantastic study spot. You walk into a beautiful and spacious patio with string lights, overhead awnings and a charming fountain. There are several types of seating options for those who require different study positions. The shop has four top tables, low couches and singular back nesting chairs. The baristas get to enjoy the fresh air by working at their outdoor stations. The outdoor fireplace enhances the ambiance and will make you feel right at home. I can confidently say this is the most beautiful coffee shop I have ever visited î not to mention the high 60s temperature in Santa Barbara all winter and spring.† Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus Aside from the amazing ambiance, the drinks are what really impressed me. Caj√© State Street has a specialty and classics menu. To prepare future coffee-goers, the specialty drinks can only be consumed in store and priced from $9.75 to $11.25. This is the most I have paid for a coffee drink but it's so worth it! Their signature drinks include the Burnout, Bella Rose, Sugarwood, Jupiter's Forest and Yamasaki. I tried the Jupiter's Forest,an iced oat latte with juniper berry, sage syrup, grapefruit zest, fresh orchid and edible gold. All I can say to this is wow! The drink itself was absolutely amazing, but the best part was the presentation. The latte was served in a cocktail glass, sugar splashed on the side of the glass and garnished with a flower. This was by far the most beautiful latte I have ever seen!† After finishing my drink, I explained to the barista how I was obsessed, and wanted to try a matcha. The barista recommended the classic drink Hojicha Latte,ù which is a toasted matcha latte. This drink was only $5 and came in a classic glass. This was one of the best matcha lattes I have had, not to mention it came with a metal straw. It's all in the details here!†† UCSB students î do not pass up this opportunity. This is a great study spot, with amazing ambiance. Or, if you're looking for a COVID-safe activity, you will enjoy hanging out here. For a fun outing, gather with your housemates and try a speciality drink while you sit by the outdoor fire. Enjoy the ambiance, quick customer service and the many details the shop has implemented. I promise, you won't regret the $10 you just spent.

From the sweet pastel-colored marshmallow shapes to even the crunchy pieces of oat that everyone else seems to hate, I love it all. With St. Patrick's Day just around the corner, I figured this would be the perfect opportunity to make a bunch of different desserts with my all-time favorite cereal. Make these lucky treats for a fun St. Patty's get-together with friends, or simply as a relaxing activity to wind down.† Sarah Ismaili / Daily Nexus Lucky Charms Cookies (yields a dozen cookies) Ingredients: Directions: Surprisingly, these cookies didn't turn out too sweet, which I appreciated while making and trying the other sugar-filled desserts. It had more of a biscuit flavor. That combined with the Lucky Charms Marshmallows made for a really mellow but still delicious cookie. Quick tip: take out the cookies a little before 12 minutes! They can burn really easily.† Sarah Ismaili / Daily Nexus Lucky Charms Rice Krispie Treats (yields 16 treats) Ingredients: Directions: This St. Patty's day treat was my personal favorite. This would be a great staple for kids or for anyone who loves rice krispy treats. It was super sticky when making it, but definitely worth it. The additional crunch from the crispy oat cereal combined really well with the sticky marshmallow whip to make a perfect sweet treat.† Sarah Ismaili / Daily Nexus Lucky Charms Milkshake: yields 4 shakes† Ingredients: Directions: I was pleasantly surprised by this shake! I didn't think it would taste like Lucky Charms very much at all from just the cereal powder and flavored milk. However, it provided just the right flavor. I like how it was subtle since it was being added to the already sweet vanilla ice cream. This is great for anyone who needs a quick sweet-tooth fix without a lot of effort.

This one, however, made feta cheese sell out in the entire country of Finland. That's right, I'm talking about the baked feta pasta. With feta being a very hotly debated cheese amongst many, this pasta promised to be tasty regardless of the massive amount of the Greek cheese that it had. We decided to put the hype to the test but, instead of following the very simple four-ingredient dish, we added our own little twists to it. Here are two different ways to make the baked feta pasta: Sarah Ismaili / Daily Nexus Recipe One: Add in the Cheeseù† Ingredients: Sarah Ismaili / Daily Nexus Directions: Many fear the original version because of the copious amount of feta. As a huge fan of the cheese, even I would agree that it is a bit salty. Adding in milder cheeses like mozzarella and parmesan definitely evened out the feta flavor and made it less intense. I also added in Sicilian blend and rosemary, offering complexity to the dish. Overall, I really enjoyed this version and think it's great for anyone who wants to try out this trend but is a little hesitant about the amount of feta.† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus Recipe 2: Add in the Veggiesù Ingredients:† Nicole Wakeland / Daily Nexus Directions:† Since I'm a fan of vegetables, I also added some baked zucchini to the dish. Feel free to add any other veggies like spinach and other leafy greens to add more nutrients. This recipe was truly so simple and delicious.

For some context, Passover celebrates the Israelites' journey from Egypt. While leaving Egypt, they did not have time for their bread to rise. Hence, we do not eat leavened bread, other wheat products and many other foods during Passover to commemorate the Israelites' journey across the desert to freedom. During Passover, Jews eat an unleavened, cracker-type food called matzah, but I have never been a huge fan. These coconut macaroons are completely kosher for Passover and taste great! Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Makes 12 macaroons Prep Time: 15 minutes Cook Time: 20 minutes Ingredients: Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Directions: Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Note: To make this recipe vegan, use aquafaba (the liquid from a chickpea can) in place of the egg whites!

On Feb. 25, the Health, Environment and Animal Rights (H.E.A.R.) club hosted a virtual cooking event in partnership with the Environment Affairs Board (EAB). The lovely Chef Emma West of Satellite Santa Barbara guided Zoom attendees through a delicious vegan cooking demonstration. West loves sourcing ingredients from local farmers' markets and using fresh ingredients whenever possible. While cooking, she highlighted amazing produce from the Santa Barbara area, including vibrant beets and beautiful carrots.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Prior to the event, West sent a simple yet flavorful recipe for a roasted vegetable dish with broccoli pesto to the attendees. All of the ingredients were relatively inexpensive and available at my local Trader Joe's. I had a great time following along with West and learning new cooking tips along the way. While my chef skills are definitely not of West's caliber, her cooking advice, such as cutting out the meaty center of a fennel bulb prior to roasting, made the final dish so much tastier.† The roasted vegetable mixture of fennel, sweet potato, carrot and shallot caramelized beautifully in the oven. I made a hearty base of farro and chickpeas for some plant-based protein and topped it off with the vegetables and broccoli pesto sauce. It's a cozy meal that's not too complicated but definitely packs a punch. You may never want to buy pesto again after trying this broccoli pesto recipe. While a professional chef led this cooking demo, anyone can make a meal like this!† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Even though I already follow a plant-based diet, this event further demonstrated how easy it is to cook a delicious vegan meal. I try to recreate vegan versions of my favorite meat-based foods, but I often find myself using vegan meat substitutes or store-bought sauce instead of using creativity in the kitchen. In reality, simple, whole ingredients often make the most satisfying meals. Especially if anyone is looking to transition to a diet more centered around plants, easy recipes like this one are a great place to start. It's never too late to ditch meat for a few nights a week and try something new!

on-the-menu,The Next Condiment to Stash in Your Fridge: Lao Gan Ma Chili Oil,12-Apr-21,8:00 AM,['Christine Tu'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-04-12/the-next-condiment-to-stash-in-your-fridge-lao-gan-ma-chili-oil/,"Christine Tu / Daily Nexus Aside from a quick mania for Harry Potter when I was 11, on principle, I never believed in magic. That is, until I discovered the mystical culinary powers of Lao Gan Ma chili oil. No joke, this simple condiment has changed my gastronomical life for the better in the short span of just a couple of weeks.† For those who aren't familiar with it, Lao Gan Ma is a popular mild chili oil that is incredibly flavorful and speckled with bits of delightfully crunchy roasted peanuts and crispy, dried chili. The oil flavoring itself is, to the woefully unrefined palate like mine, savory with an umami flavor (whatever that means), making even the blandest foods taste good. I first found out about Lao Gan Ma when my mom purchased it and began using it for her cold, marinated cucumber dish, a classic Chinese appetizer that involves marinating cucumber slices in chili oil and other condiments. I didn't realize how good it was at first, and it wasn't until I tried using a spoonful of the oil on a bowl of plain white rice that my culinary eyes were opened to the world of flavor that comes with Lao Gan Ma. Now, I'm addicted to the condiment. I've made meals out of bland filler topped with this flavorful oil to completely cheer it up. And I'm not alone in my love for Lao Gan Ma: Customers rave about it on Amazon, one reviewer saying, It is Chinese crack, and you have been warned.ù I completely agree!† A reason why Lao Gan Ma is the perfect condiment is how universally appealing the sauce is. Contrary to its name, it's hardly spicy, so it doesn't alienate those who can't stand the burning sensation of spice, like me. It's not overpoweringly pungent either, so it works well in elevating what's already there rather than drowning out the flavors. It's highly concentrated, so you only need to use a small teaspoon for each serving, giving you the most bang for your buck. For those who are looking to try out a bottle of Lao Gan Ma and aren't sure where to start, try it out by just adding a small spoonful of it to a bowl of rice and mixing it thoroughly with chopsticks until the grains are evenly coated with the oil. You can also try making cold, marinated cucumbers by adding a small spoonful of chili oil to about four thinly sliced cucumbers, mixing to incorporate the flavors and letting them marinate for an hour. Or just try it out on whatever you're eating at the moment! It truly goes well with everything, and I'm a firm believer that the best combinations are found through exploration. In the end, if you're looking for an easy way to spice things up in the kitchen (pun intended), definitely check out the Lao Gan Ma chili oil. You won't regret it!

Eyes glazed over, mind numb, I glanced at the television and immediately saw the most mouth-watering dish I had seen in a long while. Now keep in mind, I'm most definitely a tart kind of gal î I've been known to brush cakes and even the occasional pie aside to try a particularly delicious-looking fruit tart. Despite this, I have never tried a savory tart ¶ So, I was a bit skeptical when the hostess on the Food Network channel I was watching deemed the melty, flaky, steamy slice in front of her a spinach-olive tart.† That skepticism, though, didn't stop me from mentally bookmarking the meal to try later. I made a few adjustments to the recipes I found online for Greek tarta spanaki, opting to use pastry sheets rather than the traditional phyllo dough, adding in some Kalamata olives for an extra kick† and mirroring the approach for spanakopita instead (closed rather than open-faced). The result? One of the best tarts î sweet or savory î that I've ever baked! Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus Spinach-Olive Spanakopita (Adapted from Tarta Spanakiù) This recipe is meant to serve 6 (but can definitely last for longer if served alongside other courses/sides!) Prep time: ~ 20 minutes Cook time: 45 minutes Total time: ~ 65 minutes† Ingredients: Directions: Bethany Clements / Daily Nexus While I ended up with more of a traditional spinach pie, I'm sure that leaving the dish as an open-faced tart would be just as delicious. The filling, too, can be altered to your liking î I added celery, sprinkled chives on top and limited the olives to half the dish due to my family's preferences. (Make sure to share your own twists on Instagram by tagging @ucsbonthemenu!)† Eat a slice of your tart on its own, grab it for a quick snack† or serve it alongside other traditional Greek dishes for a meal laced with vivid flavors. I know I personally will be snatching leftovers for lunch this whole week! Whenever and wherever you choose to sneak a bite of your spinach-olive spanakopita, there's no doubt that its buttery, flaky crust and rich, savory filling will leave you entranced after just a single bite.

It's a debate, competition, and dare we say, war, that's raged on for centuries¶† That's right: boxed versus homemade! Your favorite (or soon-to-be favorite) neighborhood OTM writers Yuriko and Toni are here to take sides of this culinary controversy. Today, the classic chocolate chip cookie takes the spotlight. With convenience, taste, and overall vibe duking it out in the oven, will store bought or scratch win? Watch our video and follow along with our recipes. Of course, we're all winners for eating cookies, but a victor must prevail. Let us know which side you think is the winner!† Yuriko (Store Bought):† Yuriko Chavez / Daily Nexus Ingredients:† Directions: Between baking from scratch and using store-bought cookie dough, I will always choose the store-bought option. With baking store-bought cookie dough, there are so many perks î especially during the school year!† The biggest perk is how little time it takes. With an already prepared dough, I can quickly scoop the cookie dough without worrying about if I measured the flour correctly or if I added too much butter. The only thing I have to worry about is making sure I take the cookies out of the oven.† The ease and quickness of the process allowed me to bake in between classes even on my busiest weeks. Then there is the relative tidiness of it all. I don't have to bring out 5 different ingredients, clean the flour off my KitchenAid mixer, or dig through my cupboards to find vanilla extract. In about 30 minutes, I can quickly bake a fresh batch of cookies with very few dishes to clean. Finally, there is the ease. Unlike some of my other baking escapades, the taste is not necessarily consistent when re-baking a favorite recipe. With store-bought products, not only is it delicious, but it will retain the same great flavor each and every time you bake! When it comes to craving the comfort of a fresh-baked cookie î reach for the store-bought cookie dough. With speed, ease and consistency, I guarantee it'll never disappoint.† † Toni (From Scratch):† Buckwheat Chocolate Chunk Cookies Adapted from Bon Appetit. Ingredients: Directions: I am a lazy person. That being said, I love my desserts. I will take the extra time to make sure my cookies and cakes are as delicious as possible. Taking some time to make a recipe from scratch is a welcome reprieve from the stress of college life. And yes, baking does require a certain level of accuracy and concentration, but there's also so much room for improvisation. You can easily modify recipes to fit your tastebuds or accommodate your roommate's new vegan diet that we both know will be dropped next week. Baking from scratch ensures you have control over what you put in your body. I'm not saying it's healthy, but you can eliminate excess hydrogenated fats, sugar, and random chemical stabilizers that keep boxed mixes on the shelves for longer.† This chocolate chip cookie recipe is pretty easy to throw together! Most of the time is spent chilling the dough, which gives you time to do whatever else you need to do. And if you're like me, you know you'll have a cookie craving at a later date ¶ In that case, you can freeze some of the dough balls to bake off later, which will save you tons of time down the line! Take a little extra care and time to enhance your desserts. Your tastebuds (and your friends) will thank you!

Juneteenth has been celebrated since 1865, and in 1980, became a state holiday in Texas. Since then, every state except for South Dakota (really, guys?) has picked it up as a state holiday. It's long overdue that Juneteenth become a federal holiday, and a cause for extra celebration now that it has!† A little history: On Jan. 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all enslaved people within the rebelling Confederate states were now free. However, Texas didn't experience a large amount of fighting or Union presence during the Civil War. Therefore, slavery continued practically untouched in Texas, and the state became somewhat of a safe haven for slave owners.† On June 19, 1865, two and a half years after the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, General Gordon Granger and an army of Union Soldiers took to Galveston, Texas and read a general order officially declaring slaves free. While some Texas slave owners continued to hold out until December, when the 13th Amendment was ratified, this officially marked the beginning of the end for slavery in Texas and the United States. The celebration of June 19, Juneteenth for short, began that day in Texas and has been observed since as a celebration of freedom as well as Black culture, edification and education.† So, why strawberry soda? On the first Juneteenth, newly freed people celebrated in part by consuming red foods and drinks, to symbolize the blood spilled by enslaved people across the country. One of these drinks was strawberry soda, a beverage previously enjoyed by slave owners, one that slaves were prohibited from drinking. Drinking strawberry soda became an act of empowerment and rebellion and can be found in Juneteenth celebrations to this day.† While you can find it bottled, I prefer to make my own! Here's a strawberry soda recipe with a couple of extra homemade touches to make it all the more special. Fire up the barbecue, fill up a pitcher with this delicious beverage and enjoy your Juneteenth! Syrup ingredients: Soda ingredients: Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Directions: I would like to take this opportunity to say that, while it's great Juneteenth is being legitimized across the country, it is only a minor step in the direction of justice. Reparations, equity, the fight against police violence and racial inequality, and all other facets of the movement for greater social justice are far, far more important than a national holiday. It's not enough for the incredible outcry over the last year, and for centuries before, to be sated by this legislature. Frankly, it's a joke if politicians think it is enough. Enjoy Juneteenth, respect and appreciate what it stands for, but do not be appeased until real action is taken to make this country a safe, comfortable place for everyone.†

on-the-menu,Banana Bread with Nuts and Shredded Coconut,23-Sep-21,7:03 PM,['Alice Bilyk'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-23/banana-bread-with-nuts-and-shredded-coconut/,"This recipe makes an incredibly nut-heavy banana bread for when you really want to impress someone. Or yourself. Most banana bread recipes use only one or two add-ins and even then only a minimal amount. In this recipe, you use a total of 2 cups of add-ins, and it shows! The toasted nuts and coconut complement the banana flavor really well and add a lot of texture. Don't worry î it's not all nut. They're spaced out quite nicely!† I used an 11-by-5-by-3-inch pan, but this recipe would work well for a 9-by-5-by-3-inch pan as well. The banana chunks are optional but are a nice addition for texture! The coconut taste is quite mild, so if you want to up the coconut flavor, feel free to swap the butter for unrefined coconut oil. Lastly, the pistachios and almonds are interchangeable; I made it with pistachios once and almonds another time. Alice Bilyk // Daily Nexus Ingredients: Alice Bilyk // Daily Nexus Directions: Alice Bilyk // Daily Nexus îî This recipe yields a gorgeous banana bread. Apparently you're supposed to leave banana bread in the fridge for a day (or something?) in plastic wrap, but I ate this immediately after taking it out of the oven, and it was delicious. Great with vanilla ice cream and berries and cream! Whatever you little lads desire.† A version of this article appeared on p. 18 of the September 23, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,A Student's Guide to Sustainable Grocery Shopping,30-Sep-21,10:35 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-30/a-students-guide-to-sustainable-grocery-shopping/,"While I knew that making the decision to eat less meat would be better for the environment, I never realized how the way I bought groceries impacted the planet. I have always brought my own bags to the grocery store and, just like any other person, thought this was enough. However, I realized that I was subconsciously purchasing a lot of single-use plastic every time I bought groceries. Over the past few months, I've made a conscious effort to change the way I shop. Shopping more sustainably and consciously is a lot easier than you might think! Some of these tips might even save you some cash! Buy in Bulk Although bulk shopping was limited for almost a year due to COVID-19, bulk stations have reopened! I personally like shopping in bulk at the Isla Vista Food Co-op and stocking up on my favorite pantry staples. I bring my own jars to cut down on plastic î plus, bulk shopping saves me money in the long run. Buying in bulk is great for students with busy schedules who don't have time to grocery shop multiple times per week. Currently, I have bulk jars of chia seeds, brown rice and pasta in my pantry.† Stephanie Gerson // Daily Nexus Be Mindful of Packaging When in doubt, look for glass or aluminum food packaging. I love buying sauces in glass jars, such as pasta sauce or salsa, since I can rinse them out once they're finished and use them as bulk containers, plant propagation jars and more! Glass and metal can be recycled indefinitely compared to plastic, which has so many different varieties, most of which aren't actually recyclable. Most grocery stores carry a wide selection of items in glass or aluminum packaging and they are usually only a few cents more expensive than plastic-wrapped items. Stephanie Gerson // Daily Nexus Bring Your Own Bags This sounds a little obvious, but have you ever thought about bringing your own bags for unwrapped produce? I love bringing mesh produce bags or reusing older plastic produce bags at the grocery store when buying my fruits and veggies. Additionally, this hack helps prevent me from buying too much produce that might spoil in the fridge since I can choose the exact amount I wish to buy. Produce with peels, including bananas, squash and citrus fruits, can sit in your cart without a bag. Stephanie Gerson // Daily Nexus Shop With a List and Keep Your Kitchen Organized When my shelves and fridge aren't organized, I tend to overbuy since I forget what I have at home. Keep your kitchen clean rather than cluttered so you can always see the ingredients you already have! I also always bring some form of list with me to the grocery store so I can stay focused. The grocery store is one of my favorite places and I know that without a shopping list, I'd buy many things that I don't even need. Shopping with a list helps prevent food waste! Shop Local I wish I made more of an effort to visit the farmers market and shop at smaller†markets! There are two amazing farmers markets near Isla Vista: the Camino†Real Marketplace Farmers' Market on Sundays and the farmers market on State Street on Tuesdays! For a complete list of farmers markets in Santa Barbara, read more here.† Supporting local farms is great for the community, plus most farm stands do not wrap their produce in excessive packaging! Most of the items sold at farmers markets cost less too!† Stephanie Gerson // Daily Nexus îî Remember that it's very difficult to be a conscious shopper all the time. Many essential grocery items are packaged with plastic or materials that cannot be easily recycled or reused. Don't beat yourself up for buying a package of tofu wrapped in plastic or a carton of milk with a plastic cap. However, doing your part by purchasing some items in bulk, shopping from local vendors or only buying items you need are great ways to shop with the environment in mind.

The warmth of the chai spices and the sweetness of the pumpkin are perfect together! It's literally a pumpkin pie and chai latte in one loaf of bread. Bonus: This made my house smell like the purest essence of fall. The only thing I wish I had done differently is adding raisins or nuts. I adapted this from Elizabeth Lindemann's Chai Spiced Pumpkin Bread! I added a little more pumpkin than the original and a dash of turmeric and black pepper. The black pepper helps your body absorb the healthy compounds in the turmeric, but don't worry, you don't taste it!

I've always considered bourbon to be the coziest liquor.

One restaurant that took TikTok by storm was Morning Glory, a brunch restaurant in Little Italy, San Diego. The videos all over my For Youù page featured thick pancakes, crazy breakfast cocktails and decor that was one of a kind. Brunch with the girls is more than a basic concept, and Morning Glory is for anyone that's more than basic. I had the opportunity to try Morning Glory this summer and was more than impressed with my experience. My biggest tip: Go at a random time. My party of two arrived on a Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. and only had to wait about 30 minutes. When we were leaving, the wait time grew to an hour and a half. We were seated at the bar, and the decor was nothing less than stunning; the best way to describe it is a beautiful hodgepodge. In the corner hangs a giant flower with an eyeball, constantly looking at you. The booths are a beautiful pink velvet, matching the pink-and-green checkered floors. Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus I ordered the famous TikTok souffle pancakes, and they definitely lived up to the hype. The plate came with two massive, one-inch thick pancakes and a side of whipped cream and butter. The pancakes were hot, sweet and so filling. I highly recommend this dish if you are a pancake fanatic and love a sweet breakfast. Be sure to top your souffle pancakes with the whipped cream, too î it's the perfect combo of hot and cold. My friend, Summer, ordered the Morning Glory Fried Rice and Dirty Hashbrowns. Consisting of pork belly, cheese, spinach, scallions and a fried egg on top, this dish is also not to be passed on. Morning Glory Fried Rice can be underappreciated, but Morning Glory's take was flavorful, savory and filling. She stated, When first going to Morning Glory, I thought it was only going to be a cute, trendy restaurant. I didn't expect much for the food, but I was pleasantly surprised with the fun and tasty menu! I got the breakfast fried rice and the hash browns which were both super delicious!ù Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus îî In short, this brunch lived up to the social media hype. I promise you, you will definitely get your picture worth posting on Instagram here. If you ever find yourself in San Diego for the weekend or want to go on an adventure with your not-so-basic friends, you have to try Morning Glory.

This piqued my interest, and my initial reaction (like any normal human being) was, EW, THIS IS DISGUSTING!ù But then, I became genuinely interested in this zero-waste and vegan-friendly interpretation of bacon. As an avid foodie, I knew I needed to try this recipe. Now, before judging me for recreating this recipe, I think we can all agree that limiting food waste is crucial in reducing our carbon footprint. This recipe is intended for one person as it makes approximately four to five pieces of bacon. However, this recipe could easily be multiplied for sharing, as the main ingredient is bananas. Since the point of this recipe is to reduce food waste, it should ideally be made with old, browning bananas. Nevertheless, if you are dying to make this recipe and don't want to wait, any banana peel would work great! Total cooking time: 25 minutes Ingredients: Emma Barrera / Daily Nexus Directions: Emma Barrera / Daily Nexus îî After tasting this bacon,ù I would definitely recommend sticking with other vegan bacon alternatives. The banana peels did not crisp like real bacon would and they were much chewier than normal bacon. However, this was a fun experiment and allowed me to think outside the box when it comes to trying new recipes that utilize every part of the ingredient. I encourage everyone to get creative in their attempts to reduce food waste! And, hey, if you are a banana enthusiast, banana-peel bacon might just become a regular staple in your house!

on-the-menu,Love To Cook It: The Cookbook Every Plant-Based Eater Needs To Own,21-Oct-21,10:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-21/love-to-cook-it-the-cookbook-every-plant-based-eater-needs-to-own/,"I first discovered Samah Dada (@dadaeats on Instagram) when my sister sent me one of her recipes over DM and said, Finally, some vegan dessert recipes that actually look appetizing!ù Quarantine had just started, and we, like everyone else, had turned to baking to pass the time. After making a batch of her vegan chocolate chip cookies, I felt like I had found someone who truly understood plant-based cooking and didn't rely on obscure substitute ingredients to obtain great texture and taste. I purchased her debut cookbook two days after it was announced on Instagram. While I love making my own recipes and experimenting in the kitchen, I was in desperate need of inspiration. Dada Eats Love to Cook Itù was the plant-based cookbook every vegan and vegetarian was searching for. Dada's recipes pick up on flavors and ingredients from her Indian heritage as well as her time spent in London and her undergraduate education at UC Berkeley. Combine all of those influences together and you get 250 pages of fresh, comforting and innovative recipes with mouthwatering photos to match.† Dada Eats Love to Cook Itù has detailed instructions on how to make homemade hummus and crackers, chana masala, biryani, brookie pie and 95 other delicious things. While I've tried many of the recipes, here are a few favorites that really stood out to me.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus If you're looking to change up your typical breakfast, try making the One Banana Onlyù Banana Bread Muffin Tops (page 56). They're the perfect crossover between a cookie and a muffin, plus you can make them on a traditional baking sheet. While the recipe calls for one egg, I substituted the egg for a chia egg (1 tablespoon of water and 1 tablespoon of chia seeds). Filling and slightly sweet, the muffin tops will keep you satisfied throughout the morning and keep well in the fridge.† I'm a huge fan of stews, soups and porridge because they only require one pot and they're essentially foolproof. Before reading this book, I had never heard of khichdi, a comforting dish with rice, lentils and vegetables for chilly, fall evenings (page 83). This recipe requires very little preparation and does not require much attention while cooking. I love stews like this because the flavors develop more in the days after you cook it, and one batch can last several days, meaning you won't have to cook dinner every night.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus I really admire how Dada creates complex flavor profiles in her recipes without adding an excessive number of instructions or extra cooking time. A great example of this is her Masala Cauliflower & Sweet Potatoes with Cilantro-Mint Chutney (page 104). The rich blend of spices paired with the freshness of the herb chutney makes this a restaurant-quality dish. To make this recipe more of a complete meal, I served the vegetables with white rice and chickpeas.† While Dada's recipes look elaborate, several of her recipes take under 15 minutes to prepare. The Avocado Cream Pasta (page 156) truly blew me away when I first tried it. Store-bought sauces just cannot compare to the creaminess of the fresh avocado. I really loved the pairing of the slightly acidic, roasted tomatoes with the bright and garlicky avocado sauce. The pasta and grain section of Dada Eats Love to Cook Itù elevates everyday staples and turns them into easy yet flavorful meals that you will actually enjoy eating.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus How could I review a book by Samah Dada and not comment on the dessert section? I was tempted to make her classic banana bread, but instead I branched out and baked the Coconut Sugar Halva Strawberry Crumble Bars (page 191). Usually I stray away from desserts with many layers and components out of laziness, but making these crumble bars has changed my mind. While many people do not already own almond and coconut flour, these alternative flours made the most delicious crust that tasted almost buttery while using no dairy at all. The tahini used in the crumble that is sprinkled on top of the bars helped to dampen the sweetness of the strawberry and coconut sugar filling. I never thought I'd love tahini in a dessert recipe, but Dada really worked some magic in developing this recipe. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus There's something very special about owning a cookbook rather than always finding recipes online. I think of a cookbook as something you can always rely on when you aren't feeling creative in the kitchen. Growing up, I always thought recipe books had to include dishes that took hours of preparation and very specific ingredients. As someone who follows a plant-based diet, it's so refreshing to finally see a vegan-friendly cookbook that includes some recipes I know I'll love and others to try when I'm feeling more adventurous. All I can say is Dada Eats Love to Cook Itù brought back my excitement toward cooking.† A version of this article was featured on p. 12 of the October 21, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Levain-Style Ube Cookies,4-Nov-21,7:46 AM,['Melvin Ventura'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-04/levain-style-ube-cookies/,"Justin Tse / Daily Nexus While the month of October is typically known for marking the beginning of the fall season and celebrating Halloween, it is also Filipino American History Month. As the month comes to a close, I thought the best way to celebrate it was with the Philippines' favorite purple yam: ube! Known for its vibrant purple color, ube is a type of starchy tuber vegetable that is originally from the Philippines. It has a very rich, earthy and nutty flavor with a subtle sweetness that makes it a very popular ingredient in many Filipino desserts, such as ice cream and pastries. The most popular form of ube is known as ube halaya, a jam made from boiling and mashing the purple yam. You can find ube halaya or any other form of ube at any local Filipino market near you.† When thinking about how I wanted to incorporate ube into a dessert, I decided I wanted to make a cookie that was reminiscent of the cookies from the famous Levain Bakery in New York City. The cookies from Levain Bakery are massive, with a perfectly crisp, golden brown exterior and a gooey, melty texture on the inside. There are many different recipes online that attempt to replicate the cookies, but my favorite one is from Delish. I adapted this recipe and put my own Filipino twist on it by incorporating some ube halaya and ube extract. You can watch their Test Kitchen Manager, June, walk you through the steps of the recipe in their video Giant Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies By June | Delishù on Youtube.† † Ingredients: Directions:† These cookies are definitely best enjoyed when they are warm, as the doughy interior and the white chocolate chips just completely melt in your mouth. They're also perfect with a nice, cold glass of milk. Enjoy, and Happy Filipino American History Month!† A version of this article was featured on p. 11 of the November 4, 2021 print edition 0f the Daily Nexus

on-the-menu,Lilac Patisserie Review,4-Nov-21,7:52 AM,['Maya Ades'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-04/lilac-patisserie-review/,"Maya Ades / Daily Nexus As a person with celiac, a gluten allergy, I've been meaning to try Lilac P√¢tisserie, a gluten-free bakery and caf√© located in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara. One Sunday, I coerced a few people into coming along with me so that I could try as much food as possible. We set out for brunch, set on ordering the entire menu.† I decided on the breakfast sandwich, which consisted of Black Forest ham, a fried egg, arugula and melted cheddar cheese in between two pieces of brioche bread. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that there was pesto spread on the bread as well. The salty flavors of the ham paired well with the sweeter brioche bread and, of course, who could possibly complain about melted cheese and pesto? It was a delicious sandwich, especially with a bit of Cholula Hot Sauce. My friend Fatima also had the breakfast sandwich and ordered a side of potatoes to go with it. The potatoes were cooked with onions and red peppers, which were all brought nicely together with oregano. My other friend Sarah is a vegan, so she was initially a bit worried about whether she would be able to eat at a restaurant that primarily caters to gluten-free eaters. Well, she need not have worried, because she was able to try the red velvet cupcake and carrot cake cupcake î both of which are vegan. The carrot cake cupcake was a big hit, because the ratio of raisins to cake was spot-on, and the frosting on top was cream cheese-y and smooth. She also liked the red velvet cupcake, though she did say that the typical fan of red velvet might not love it. It lacked the strong chocolate flavor that people often associate with red velvet, but the frosting was good overall and not too sweet. The cupcakes were both a bit dense, although you do tend to get that with gluten-free baked goods in general. Maya Ades / Daily Nexus Sklyer ordered the Belgian Waffles, which she was very happy about ¶ once they got there. Be warned that the waffles take a bit longer to make, so if you are starving, maybe go for something else. Skyler said that her waffles were the perfect density, fluffy while still being filling. In addition, the strawberries, blueberries and raspberries on top of the waffle were perfectly ripe and yummy! Like Sarah, Izzy opted for a baked good, choosing a slice of New York cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious and smooth, not too sweet and a little tangy from cream cheese. I tried it, and it was the best gluten-free cheesecake I've ever had. I would recommend this cake again and again. Maya Ades / Daily Nexus As expected of any college students in the middle of midterms, we had to buy coffee as well. I had a pumpkin spice latte, which was amazingly creamy and delicious. The hot matcha latte and the iced latte were both good, although the cold brew was a bit strong.† I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, gluten allergy or not! Not only is the food very yummy, the restaurant has a fun atmosphere, both in the cafe and outdoors at the street seating. The employees at Lilac P√¢tisserie are all very nice and helpful, creating a very good experience overall.

Located at 888 Embarcadero del Norte, between The Habit Burger Grill and Starbucks, it marks the introduction of, so far, the only dedicated chicken wing restaurant in I.V. Expanding our presence in Isla Vista was the next logical step for us as Wingstop continues to grow in popularity within the market,ù Gail Hill, a field marketing manager for Wingstop, said in a statement to the Nexus. The restaurant itself is located in an area with a strong community presence; where students, individuals and families alike live, work and play.ù About a dozen people, mostly students, waited in line for the opening. The first person in line was Nick Tomlin, a second-year political science major at UC Santa Barbara. I'm a big proponent of Wingstop superiority,ù Tomlin said, chuckling. I will be visiting here religiously.ù The food appeared not to contradict his beliefs. The food's amazing,ù Tomlin said. I got what I expected, and it's just very fulfilling.ù Amaya Zabalza, a third-year sociology major, was impressed with the speed of the service. Like Tomlin, she expressed a loyalty to Wingstop. I used to drive to Ventura my freshman year to go to Wingstop,ù she said. Now, it's kind of nice that it's only five minutes away.ù Hannah Horenstein, a second-year economics and accounting and communications double major, shared Tomlin and Zabalza's positivity. It smells absolutely amazing,ù she said of her order. And I know it's gonna taste better than it smells.ù I think this is gonna be a very popular spot,ù she added. In attendance as well was Charlie Walz, the director of business development at PopID. PopID is a service which uses facial recognition for payments; Wingstop in I.V. is an adopter. I will be here quite often,ù Walz said. I only eat where they take PopPay in this town. So having a new wing place is amazing.ù As for what Wingstop brings to I.V., Tomlin, the customer who was first in line, had a simple answer. You go to a pizza place î they have wings, but it's a pizza place,ù he said. Now we have Wingstop.ù A version of this article was featured on p. 11 of the November 4, 2021 print edition 0f the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,Oliver's of Montecito,9-Nov-21,1:52 PM,['Jill Ridens'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-09/olivers-of-montecito/,"This week's review is for all the college students who are too broke to eat at a nice restaurant. Yes, we are talking about me. My mom came up to visit me in Santa Barbara and said she would take me anywhere I wanted for dinner. Conveniently, I had always wanted to try a boujee, upscale, celebrity-spotting restaurant just down the 101. Oliver's of Montecito is an all-vegan, California-casual dinner restaurant. This place was everything I wanted and more; I cannot emphasize enough that it is a must-try. Let me set the stage. Located in the heart of Montecito, Oliver's is a beautiful indoor-outdoor restaurant with beautiful trees, string lights and an amazing setting for photos. I would recommend a reservation, as it was busy even on a Thursday night. The menu had a lot of shared plates, so I would suggest sharing dishes with your group to try a little bit of everything. It's a lovely, intimate setting, but they also have a small bar with a TV indoors.† Let's get to the good stuff. Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus To start, my group ordered the Endless Summerù cocktail, the Mr. Pinkù cocktail and a Moscow Mule. All of these drinks were the perfect end to summer î refreshing, fruity and light. They were also $17, so this is why Oliver's is for a special occasion. For appetizers, our server suggested the Roman Style Artichoke Hearts and the Kung Pao Cauliflower. Both starters were a 10/10. My personal favorite was Roman Style Artichoke Hearts which consisted of feta-stuffed Peppadew peppers, bread crumbs and lemon aioli. The starters were perfect for a party of four.† Now to the main event.† Because we had some starters to share, we all ordered salads as our main course. I enjoyed the Oliver's Apple Salad, which consisted of Fuji apples, apple chips, candied pecans, smoked almond goat cheese, red onion and avocado, topped off with a champagne vinaigrette. The salad was a smaller portion, perfect to eat with the many appetizers we had. This was one of the best vegan cheeses I've tried î it was so creamy and smooth, making for another 10/10. Now for the grand finale. For dessert, we tried the apple pie crumble and the key lime crumble. Both were absolutely delicious, but my favorite was the apple pie crumble. I'm usually not a huge fan of vegan desserts, but this was to die for. The crust was made out of oats and stuffed with hot apples and topped with a vanilla sorbet. I can now say I've lived.† Overall, I would highly recommend Oliver's to anyone. It's definitely a nice restaurant that can be saved for special occasions when you're ready to spend some money. For those who aren't vegan like myself, it's still worth the hype. I'm already planning another trip back here soon.†

As someone whose feed is constantly filled with food videos, I honestly was not sure if brie was trending on Food TikTok or if it was just the algorithm doing its thing. I know for sure though that I was definitely inspired to make something with the soft and creamy French cheese.† These brie-raspberry tarts are super simple and easy to make. I constructed these little delicacies on top of sheets of frozen puff pastry that can be found in the frozen section of any grocery store. I then topped each sheet with a layer of tangy homemade raspberry compote, slices of the brie cheese, fresh raspberries, pistachios and a drizzle of honey. After constructing the tarts, you just pop them in the oven and they're ready to go! Their sweet and savory flavor makes them a great potential appetizer for the Thanksgiving dinner table and will definitely impress your friends and family.† Ingredients:† Raspberry Compote Brie-Raspberry Tarts† Directions:† These tarts are definitely best enjoyed when they're warm and fresh out of the oven. All of the different components compliment each other so well and combine to create a unique savory and sweet flavor profile with a hint of tartness.

Below are some of the main adjustments you can make without affecting the integrity of the dish.† Any type or quantity of rice can be used î just adjust the amount of stock per the instructions on the rice packaging. Additionally, any vegetables can be substituted or omitted per preference. The celery can be substituted with either 1/2 of an onion or 2 shallots, the cilantro can be substituted with parsley, the lettuce can be substituted with any type of greens and any type of olives can be used. Ingredients: Directions: I hope you enjoy making (and eating) this slightly different iteration of fried rice! You can also fry up some walnuts or sunflower seeds in a little olive oil and black pepper to garnish, or serve with a little tzatziki sauce.

The homemade dishes present at the potluck included: butternut squash soup, roasted sweet potatoes, butternut squash boats, stuffing, roasted vegetables, hummus, yams with marshmallows, Thanksgiving loaves, ratatouille and muffins.

on-the-menu,The Ultimate Friendsgiving Menu,25-Nov-21,12:44 PM,['Katherine McCabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-25/the-ultimate-friendsgiving-menu/,"Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Friendsgiving has become a ubiquitous informal supplement to the holiday season, allowing those who celebrate a chance to spend time with, and be thankful for, their friends in addition to their families. The advantages to friendsgiving are twofold: Your friends aren't as likely to pester you about visiting home more often or removing your nose piercing, and more control over the menu means you won't have to suffer through your aunt's quaggy creamed onion recipe. Freed from the shackles of family tradition, friendsgiving allows participants to branch out and share creative recipes with their friends. Here's a comprehensive list of possible dish ideas for a well-rounded friendsgiving that's accommodating, too, for the different dietary needs of your friend group.† Main Dishes The star of the show at Thanksgiving, as per tradition, is the turkey. And if you want to be a traditionalist, there's nothing wrong with that! This Tastes Better From Scratch recipe walks you through an easy, no-frills process. If you respect the timeless turkey but want to amble outside of the world of classic roast bird, try some deep-fried turkey legs, a turkey shepherd's pie or Puerto Rican pavochon. For those unafraid to betray custom, impress your friends with these wine and mustard-braised chicken thighs. In a pinch or on a budget, there's nothing wrong with a Costco rotisserie chicken.† Vegetarian alternatives to the turkey centerpiece are, in my opinion, skippable. Have you ever had a tofurkey? With such a plethora of vegan and vegetarian dishes that are simply delicious standing on their own, why settle for a squishy blob of soy? If you have an acceptable vegan imitation turkey, I'd love to hear about it. But for now, you can wow even your meat-eating friends with a hearty centerpiece like this tahini-roasted cauliflower, vegan pot pie or behemoth squashducken.† Side Dishes (Healthy) While thanksgiving feastù and healthyù are rarely used in the same sentence, lighter dishes are actually an integral part of a Thanksgiving meal. In her book Salt Fat Acid Heat,ù chef Samin Nosrat laments her first American Thanksgiving being wholly disappointing. Her main complaint was the lack of acidity î the reason cranberry sauce tastes so good, she explains, is because it is the only traditionalù Thanksgiving dish that comes with a pH low enough to provide contrast to the largely creamy and heavy dishes that dominate the table. Plus, loading up on a kale salad (try this one with quinoa and butternut squash) gives an excuse to indulge in an extra slice of pie. It's all about balance, right? Pack some zing on your plate with these ginger green beans, celebrate fall flavors with this beet-and-apple salad or provide an alternative to the buttery status quo by making this lighter brussel sprout salad. If you plan on sharing the table with the more classic, heavier dishes like mashed potatoes or mac and cheese, try adding a little bit more acid (think vinegar or lemon juice) to these recipes to achieve the total plate balance that Nosrat talks about. These dishes will need to pack a little extra punch to balance out the cream and butter of the less healthy dishes.† Side Dishes (Less Healthy) As a longtime vegetarian in a family of meat-eaters, mashed potatoes have always been the centerpiece of my Thanksgiving. Elevate yours by adding a dollop of sour cream or cream cheese in addition to the standard butter and milk (sub milk for half-and-half or heavy cream if you're really trying to impress your friends and not care for their digestive health). For the vegans or lactose intolerant, there is no shortage of dairy-free mashed potato recipes. It's tough to beat a classic baked mac and cheese, of which there are also vegan alternatives. Creamy cauliflower casserole is always a good option (for this recipe, I might recommend adding parsley and subbing prosciutto for bacon), as is a classic stuffing î and, if you're short on time, Trader Joe's even has a pre-made stuffing mix (and a gluten free one!). If you somehow don't have enough casseroles yet, this brussel sprout gratin is a decadent take on an oft-hated vegetable.†† Finger Foods Whether they're served as an appetizer or along with the main course, finger foods are always fun and easy. My personal favorites are these polenta mushroom bites, artichoke phyllo cups, sweet potato stacks and adorable baked bries. For something of lower effort, feel free to cobble together a charcuterie board or throw some garlic bread in the oven.† Desserts Whether or not you're a Thanksgiving purist, you have to acknowledge the superiority of pumpkin pie. You can pick up some gluten-free pie crust at Sprouts or Albertsons, or veganize the filling and top it with some coconut cream. Stay on the autumnal theme with some apple cobbler or some seasonal pomegranate desserts (take your pick!). Or, for the ease of no slicing, revert back to finger foods î dessert mode î with some pumpkin-chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodle truffles or these vegan, gluten-free chocolate-peanut butter bites. No matter your dietary restrictions or personal tastes, there's something for everyone at friendsgiving.†

One of my favorite places in LA is Santa Monica; it has the beach, great shopping, amazing views and the best restaurants. One of my favorites in particular is √âlephante, a coastal-casual restaurant with ocean views and a beach-house vibe. Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus √âlephante is decked out with wicker, wood and stone, which transport guests to the Southern Mediterranean region. To be immersed into this tropical oasis, guests must take an elevator to the third floor. The patio outside is small but probably has the best view. However, every spot in the restaurant is great, as it is so bright and airy, making for great lighting for photos.† Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus To the good stuff: food and drinks. What makes √âlephante unique is their extensive wine list. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and happy to recommend wines that would go well with our food. Their wines feature mostly Italian brands, with over 30 options. As drinks were delivered to other tables, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful cocktails that were coming out from the bar! All the cocktails were bright and fun, incorporating that tropical beach-house vibe.† Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus My party of two ordered the fried calamari, vodka sauce pasta and gemelli pasta. The vodka sauce pasta was to die for! It was so creamy, perfectly cooked and definitely worth going back for. The gemelli pasta was definitely one of the most unique pastas I've had. The pasta has squid ink, Dungeness crab, tomato butter and chili. When the black-colored pasta came out, I was shocked and scared to try it, but it ended up being super delicious. Italian Los-Angelinan Zach DeSanto said, The only time I have seen squid ink pasta was when I lived in Italy, and seeing it in the States was really cool. I would definitely return for the food and the upbeat vibe.ù Overall, √âlephante has a great vibe. It's definitely hard to make a reservation because it's so popular, but you just have to plan ahead. It's a little pricey for the average college student, as the average entree goes for about $30. Definitely check out √âlephante if you are in LA or want to make the trip down from SB for a fun night out.

If fig butter was a person, I imagine she would be a classy grandma beating everyone at bingo î heavenly sweetness and witty, with an indescribable depth.

You make a curry paste and then fry it with your vegetables and a little coconut milk! This recipe for curry paste (and curry dish) is intended as a low-FODMAPS alternative, since more traditional curry pastes tend to have lots of onion and garlic in them, potentially along with other alliums like shallots and green onions. Despite the substitutions, this curry paste is every bit as warm, aromatic and umami-hitting as a regular curry î not to mention the nutty flavor of the black rice and the sweetness of the squash! Another very fall-esque recipe to curl up in bed and forget about midterms with.† This curry paste recipe is adapted from Karlijn's Thai Yellow Curry With Shrimps (Low FODMAP)ù with slight substitutions and quantity changes. If you would like to make a more traditional curry paste, or even want to buy one premade, just substitute that in for the curry paste in the recipe! Additionally, this curry paste recipe makes more than is called for in the dish, so feel free to freeze the excess in a jar, and it'll stay good for months!

I think the last time I went a single day without eating meat was three years ago; meat has always been the foundation of my diet, for reasons you'll find out later in this piece. Over the past few years, I've become much more interested in plant-based diets. As my concern for the environment grows, plant-based eating appears as an important choice in a lot of the sustainability research I do. Plus, I publish so much plant-based content for this paper! Seeing week after week of delicious, vegan food, the diet seemed intriguing. So, I decided to challenge myself to eat plant-based for a week. Here are a couple of things I'm going to try to get out of this challenge: first, creativity. I think eliminating animal products from my diet will push me to be a little more creative with the food I make. I usually end up falling into a rut, producing the same few meals every week, which gets boring. Secondly, and more importantly, I want to see if a plant-based diet works for me so that I can eat more sustainably.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Day 1 Day one started with a three-and-a-half-hour, traffic-ridden drive to Isla Vista from my home in Orange County. I arrived at around 2:00 p.m. on an empty stomach, starving. I threw some rice in my rice cooker to work its magic while I unpacked, then pan-fried some potatoes, mushrooms and carrots. I seasoned it all with oregano, cumin and paprika, then put the veggies into some tortillas for a vegan taco lunch. I topped the tacos with red cabbage sauerkraut that I purchased at Fermentation Farm, a must-stop every time I go home. If you live in the Costa Mesa area, please check them out! I added cilantro (from my garden!) and lime to the rice, and ate it on the side. The first meal of vegan week down, in delicious fashion. 13 more to go.† Dinner was decidedly less creative. My girlfriend and I got a couple of ingredients out, considered them, then put them away and opted for pizza instead. I must say, there was a twinge of pain un-checking the pepperoniù and baconù boxes. Being lactose intolerant, I always opt for vegan cheese, so at least I wasn't making any concessions there.† Overall, a solid day of eating that left me full and satisfied! I did start to crave chicken towards the end of the day, which was a little frightening. Was I so used to eating meat that a day without it was already inspiring cravings? Get a grip, dude. It'd be interesting to see how that evolved over the course of the week ¶ Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Day 2 Instead of eating breakfast, I usually opt for an early-ish lunch. That was the case today when I built myself a hearty bowl of roasted potatoes, carrot shreds, kidney beans, shredded lettuce (from mythe garden!), kraut and day one's leftover rice. I squeezed half a lime over it and covered it in nutritional yeast, as well as some vegan buffalo sauce. Delish. An hour or two later, I started to feel a little ¶ odd. Lightheaded, woozy, floaty. Having no formal education in nutrition, I decided I might be low in iron, considering I'd gone a whole 36 hours without eating meat. So, I whipped up a quick chia pudding that I let marinate, stew, gelatinize ¶ whatever you call that process, while I worked out. It was a nice post-exercise, early afternoon treat. Around 4:00 p.m. is when I faced a big roadblock, something that would probably be the single most complicating factor in this challenge: my stomach. The beans were making themselves known, to put it lightly, and doing so in a rather painful way. I have an incredibly sensitive stomach, almost embarrassingly so. Looking at a list of vegan proteins, my options seemed dim. Beans? Ouch. Nuts? A digestive no-no for me. Seeds? Nope! Soy? Almost as bad as beans. Seitan? I'm gluten-intolerant. Through the gauntlet constructed by my many digestive obstacles, there's always been one meal I can count on: some variety of cooked meat, veggies and starch. This trifecta makes up 90% of the meals I eat and covers almost every base I need to be covered without hitting any of my intestinal tripwires. With this option gone, I was going to have some trouble getting protein. That was a problem for day three, though.† I decided on a light, Thai-inspired noodle dish with zucchini and mushrooms for dinner. Having to leave fish sauce, my favorite umami bomb, out of this dish was a bummer. Fish sauce is great for adding that deep, meaty flavor to any recipe, especially one without meat ¶ if only this was a vegetarian challenge.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus Day 3 Protein day! For lunch, I made sweet potato toast with an avocado/tomato mash. Divine. On the side, I had a salad with some shredded lettuce, parsley, tomatoes and quinoa (one of the suggested vegan proteins I can actually digest) with a dressing of olive oil and tamarind puree. A little nutritional yeast took it to the next level. A delicious lunch! So far, I've been eating pretty damn well. My meals thus far were all satisfying, beautiful and fun to make.† It was time to break out the nutrition calculator. I entered rough approximations of my recipe, ran the calculator, and ¶ was pretty surprised with the result! According to the calculator, my meal had netted me 30 grams of protein, nearly 50% of my RDV (recommended daily value). Pretty solid!† Wanting to hit my goal of 63 grams of protein, I decided dinner would be this Squash and Lentil Soup by Ambitious Kitchen. It tasted delicious, but, unfortunately, had only 16.3 grams of protein per serving î†I fell short of my goal by almost 17 grams. However, that did not stop the powers of plant protein from seriously punishing my digestive tract. Awesome! Out of curiosity, I added half a pound of chicken to the calculator. It doubled the amount of protein in a serving, bringing the total to 32.7 grams. By adding two or three chicken thighs, I would have met my protein goal. That was a little disheartening to see.† While day three was full of delicious food, it was starting to become clear why a plant-based diet isn't sustainable for me, and that if I was going to go the distance, a solution to this protein problem would need to be discovered soon.† Day 4 Remember what I said about going the distance? Yeah, that wasn't going to happen. I woke up on day four feeling extremely nauseous, nearly sick to the point of seeing day three again. I decided to call off the challenge here. There was no point in suffering through another four days of intestinal distress just to say I'd gone a week. Maybe if I had stuck it out, my body would have gotten used to the plant protein, but I wasn't willing to take the risk.† That isn't to say I didn't gain anything from this challenge. Going back to my goals from day one, the creativity box was most certainly checked. I came up with some dishes that are definitely going on my weekly menu. Day three's sweet potato toast was absurdly delicious. More importantly, I gained a new awareness of my nutrition. I had never used a nutrition calculator before; I had always assumed that because I was eating meat, veggies and carbs, I was getting everything I needed. Despite not hitting my goal, using the nutrition calculator felt great. I knew exactly what I needed to eat more of and what I needed to cut back on. Eating mindfully is essential.† Above all else, I gained an appreciation for my current diet.† Throughout these three days, I found a voice in my head asking, Why?ù and Wouldn't this be better with meat?ù Now, that might have been the little, carnivorous goblin who lives in my brain making his cravings known, but I think there's a simpler, less horrifying answer. The idea behind this challenge was to see if a plant-based diet would work for me, in order to eat sustainably. I forgot to consider that I already do. That little, carnivorous goblin has a point! I mainly eat meat from regenerative farms that pasture raise their animals. These farms support the environment, just like a vegan diet can, by employing grazing practices that revive previously destroyed soil, increasing carbon drawdown and improving the water cycle*. I had already been eating a sustainable diet while not absolutely wrecking my gut every day.† In today's media of extremism, I see a lot of calls for everyone to go vegan. I also see a lot of calls for people to keep eating meat, calling veganism stupid and unhealthy. The issue isn't black and white; there's no one answer for everyone. Some people thrive on a vegan diet. As much as I would like to eat plant-based food for the sake of the environment, it's simply not an option for me. That doesn't mean, however, that somebody like me is exempt from making more sustainable dietary choices. While there's no perfect diet,ù everyone still is capable of and has a responsibility to eat more sustainably. In buying meat, I choose to support sustainable, regenerative farmers who pasture-raise their animals instead of opting for disgustingly unsustainable and negligent factory-farmed meats. Primal Pastures, a local farm my family has been buying our meat from for years, is a perfect example of a place to buy meat that is farmed in a way that actively helps regenerate an environment stunted by unsustainable and disrespectful farming practices.† I implore you to push yourself, dietarily speaking. Try new things, see what works for you, and please, keep the environment in mind.† *Added in an edit on December 16, 2021
Print You weren't eating any fat and your blood sugar was going haywire. More than meat, you need the animal fat that goes with it. Hi Chace :) it seems like you had some trouble because instead of finding vegan recipes you eliminated things from your old recipes. I'd recommend trying out a recipe made to be vegan (maybe once a week) so it doesn't feel like you're missing out on flavors! That really helped me:)
Your colleagues, like Stephanie and Celine, have put up some awesome vegan recipes on On the Menuù that you should look at! I'm sorry that you didn't have the best experience cooking without animals. Whatever your personal experience, it seems wrong to claim that some [animal] farms support the environment, just like a vegan diet canù without providing any support for this view. According to Our World in Data (who, in turn, rely on the largest meta-analysis of global food systems to date, published in Science by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek [in 2018]ù): Plant-based protein sources ì tofu, beans, peas and nuts ì have the lowest carbon footprint. This is certainly true when you compare average emissions. But it's still true¶†Read more ª

on-the-menu,Celebrity Christmas Recipes: Taylor Swift's Chai Tea Eggnog Cookies,12-Dec-21,8:00 AM,['Melvin Ventura'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-12-12/celebrity-christmas-recipes-taylor-swifts-chai-tea-eggnog-cookies/,"Melvin Ventura / Daily Nexus We all have traditional Christmas recipes that we love to make, but have you ever thought about making recipes curated by your favorite celebrities? This December, I decided that the best way to get into the holiday spirit is by testing out some celebrity Christmas recipes. As a huge Swiftie, I figured it would be appropriate for me to kick off this series with Taylor Swift's chai tea eggnog sugar cookies. Taylor originally published the recipe in a 2015 Tumblr post, but you can also find the recipe in Seventeen Magazine. The recipe for the base of Swift's cookies was adapted from JoytheBaker.com. Swift put her own spin on Joy's famous sugar cookies by adding a chai tea packet.† Prior to this attempt, I must admit that I was quite skeptical about the chai tea and eggnog combination, but Swift knew exactly what she was doing by combining these two. The flavor of these cookies perfectly encapsulates what the holiday season and Taylor Swift are all about. They have that classic sugar cookie-vanilla flavor that you could never go wrong with, but the spice from the cinnamon, chai and nutmeg adds so much complexity to it. The texture of these cookies is also perfect if you're a fan of really soft cookies. They're really similar to the frosted sugar cookies that you can find at grocery stores but so much lighter. The icing that goes on top perfectly compliments the base: It's not overly sweet and it does not overpower the cookie. Not to mention, the icing-to-cookie ratio is perfect.† The recipe for these cookies is a standard cookie recipe, but I do have a few tips to ensure that these cookies come out the way I imagine Swift envisioned them. First, the dough is going to be really soft and runny, so chilling it until it is firm is really important. Another thing that I would suggest is to sift the flour and the powdered sugar to avoid any lumps in the dough or the icing and to make mixing easier. Lastly, in terms of the icing, I found that 1 tablespoon of eggnog was not enough to get the desired consistency. Instead, 3-4† tablespoons was the amount that gave me the best consistency. You don't want the icing to be too thick as the cookies are really delicate, so a thin icing that you can gently spoon over would be best. The warm, complex flavor of these cookies makes them the perfect cookie for any winter occasion. They would definitely stand out at any Christmas party and can even make for a suitable gift for your friends, especially if they're also Swifites. These are the cookies that you will want to make for those cozy winter nights with your loved ones while you watch a Christmas movie by the fireplace in your cute Christmas pajamas. I'm sure that's how Taylor would spend her nights making them.† Ingredients:† Chai Tea Sugar Cookies Eggnog Icing† Directions:† Honestly, what can Taylor Swift not do? She can sing, write and now I've discovered that she can create some amazing cookies as well. These cookies are the ultimate Christmas cookie. They're simple, elegant, pretty and have a really unique warm, Christmas-y flavor. Make them with your fellow Swiftie friends while streaming your favorite album by Swift for the perfect Christmas-time dessert.

on-the-menu,Breaking Down The Top Food Trends of 2021,29-Dec-21,4:44 PM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-12-29/breaking-down-the-top-food-trends-of-2021/,"2021 presented itself as another year of constantly rotating viral food trends. Many of these trendy recipes enjoyed a few weeks in the spotlight while others are still wildly popular. Let's take a trip down memory lane and relive some of the internet's favorite foods of this year. Have some of these trends become staples in our diets or are they just fads? 1. Feta pasta and rise of vegan feta Baked feta pasta took the internet by storm in the early days of 2021. It's essentially a one-pan meal that's creamy and packed with flavor. I was a little late to the trend and made my first baked feta dish over the summer, but I was pretty impressed! It has definitely become a comfort meal of mine. I noticed that the recipe's popularity led to an increase in non-dairy feta cheese options in grocery stores, including Trader Joe's. However, I think this trend won't carry on into 2022. For an in-depth review of the viral recipe, read this article by Daily Nexus writers Nicole Wakeland and Sarah Ismaili.† 2. Emily Mariko salmon bowl† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Emily Mariko (@emilymariko) charmed TikTok with her aesthetically pleasing grocery hauls and soothing cooking videos filmed in a beautiful kitchen. In September, Emily shared her salmon rice recipe consisting of mashed salmon, white rice, kewpie mayo, soy sauce, sriracha, avocado, kimchi, and nori sheets. I attempted to make my own vegan version using tofu as a salmon substitute. While the recipe is definitely delicious, I don't see a resurgence of this meal happening in 2022.† 3. Pickling at home During the early stages of the pandemic, many stockpiled on food in fear of shortages due to supply chain interruptions. Additionally, excessive trips to the grocery store were discouraged. In an effort to pick up a new hobby and preserve fresh food for as long as possible, every home cook started pickling and canning their vegetables. OTM writer Laura Tucker took a stab at the decades-old preservation method in her raw cider pickles article. I pickled carrots for the first time this year and I can't wait to pickle more things next year! 4. Baked oats I have to admit, I never attempted to make baked oats. I really love the concept and I think the cake-like texture won over a lot of oatmeal haters. The one downside to this trend is that, unlike instant oats, your breakfast takes 25 minutes to cook. I'm predicting that oat muffins, that can be made in batches and prepped ahead of time, will be more popular in the new year.† 5. Wellness beverages Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Many drinks marketed to calm people down during a stressful time became widely available this year. We saw ingredients such as CBD and adaptogenic mushrooms hit the shelves in drinks by brands including Recess and Centr. Lured by the drinks' claims to increase focus and relaxation, I tried a variety of wellness beverages and saw no change in my mood or productivity. While I like the concept, I think high-stress individuals might look elsewhere for relief.†† 6. Plant-based foods† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus As a plant-based eater, I was pleasantly surprised that more restaurants and grocery stores increased the number of meat-free options. One of my favorite new vegan products of 2021 was Nancy's oat milk yogurt. Almost every restaurant now has an Impossible burger on the menu or a vegetarian option that isn't cheese pizza. Looking forward, it's likely that plant-based diets will be more focused on whole foods rather than meat and dairy substitutes with questionable ingredients.† We never know what the next food trend will be, but you can count on the On the Menu writers to review the latest viral dishes.

on-the-menu,Janchi-Guksu,13-Jan-22,10:05 AM,['Michelle Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-13/janchi-guksu/,"Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Everyone has those dishes that remind them of their childhood. For me, that dish is janchi-guksu (ÏûîÏπòÍµ≠Ïàò), which roughly translates to festival noodles.ù While traditionally for large parties, janchi-guksu is a dish my grandma would make for my siblings and me as an after-school snack. Growing up, this dish was actually not my favorite î I found the plain anchovy broth with thin noodles boring, my Americanized taste buds craving something more flavorful (preferably with cheese). But now that I'm older and living further away from home, I have a newfound appreciation for the dish's simplicity. Unlike ramen, pho or other Asian noodle dishes that slap you in the face with flavor, janchi-guksu has an understated flavor profile that is warmly comforting î kind of like a hug in a bowl.† During break, I had a lot of free time so I attempted to recreate my grandma's janchi-guksu. While obviously nothing can beat the real deal, I think it came pretty close. Ingredients (Serves 2): Noodles Broth Toppings Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Directions: Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus The highlight of janchi-guksu is the broth. The subtle anchovy flavor is enhanced by the soy sauce and other aromatics, creating a nice, clean broth that won't make you feel bleh after eating it. While making janchi-guksu from scratch definitely takes time, from letting the broth simmer to slicing up the toppings, you're left with a comforting dish that will warm you up from the inside out.

A super perfect, toasty, brothy, soupy bean recipe for a chilly insulation-free I.V. night. Yes, it takes a long time. But, it's a set-it-and-forget-it kind of recipe and all good things take time. The beans and mushrooms are perfectly soft, warm and umami, the toast is crunchy and the scallions are fresh; they're a really great winter meal since they fill you up and warm you from inside.† Alice Bilyk / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: î These beans would be great in any form. On their own, on toast, on rice, as a side, etc. For reheating, I just refried them in a pot with some of the broth until they warmed through.

A favorite among college students, the national chain with a neighborhood heart offers tasty, relatively healthy and affordable food options. I sit down with my good friend Grace, a second-year environmental science major and spirited TJ's employee, to hear her tips on how anyone can maximize their enjoyment of this grocery wonder.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Do: Get goodies for having a good eye. Grace's first recommendation for any Trader Joe's visit is to locate the hidden stuffed animal and claim one's bounty. Secure yourself a free lollipop and maybe some stickers.† Don't: Try the grapes. Grace admonishes those who go for an unoffered snack. That's not cool,ù she says. Besides, the chain is famous for its free samples. If you must eat in the store, stick to what they offer you.† Do: Try the Sparkling Peach Tea. Grace's description of the beverage? Crack.ù Don't: Treat TJ's as your sole produce provider.† Grace exalts the store's aptitude for premade meals and inventive snacks, while addressing their shortcomings in produce. What we come short on [in produce] we excel in other products,ù Grace said. Instead, I recommend visiting the farmers market for excellent produce and an excellent boost to your superiority complex. Do: Frozen and pre-prepared foods. For the college lifestyle, Grace strongly recommends the frozen section. You find a lot of good stuff for relatively cheap,ù Grace said, and it lasts you.ù She points to the store's refrigerated prepared foods section as a convenient way to expand one's palette. The grab-and-go meals save shoppers the commitment of purchasing each separate ingredient, as well as the time, effort and ability needed to successfully execute a new dish.† Do: Fresh salmon.† Grace assures me preparation is simple. Easy cook, just pop it in the oven, 425 degrees Fahrenheit, 23 minutes, throw some lemon slices, put some seasoning on there, maybe a little thing of butter and let it marinate¶[into a] melt-in your-mouth type meal,ù Grace said of the fish.† I remind her that salmon, prepared exactly this way, was the first thing we cooked together, and yes, it did melt in my mouth. She considers this salmon meal as an introduction to the intimate relationshipù one can have with Trader Joe's.† This intimacy and sense of community does not exist by chance. It is the store's mission to make customers feel that TJ's is not only a grocery store, but your friends down the street,ù Grace said. As an employee, she knows how to make shopping at Trader Joe's enjoyable and understands that being a friendly face is a big part of the job.ù† In addition to being friendly, the people that work at TJ's are welcoming, knowledgeable and, more often than not, hot as fuck. The store is a vaguely Hawaiian-themed haven, with one-of-a-kind products that rotate at precisely the right speed to get you attached, heartbroken, then hooked again on the next new thing. So visit Trader Joe's, and retreat into the illusion that life is dependable and fun is for sale. Happy shopping!

Within this paradise, you can find a wide palette of diverse desserts that can suit anybody's interest. Whether you're craving cookies or ice cream, there is something to cater to anyone's sweet tooth. Here is a short list of our favorite locations for the best dessert spots in Orange County.† Lauren Huang / Daily Nexus 1. Sidecar Doughnuts & Coffee Sidecar Doughnuts is an absolute dessert staple when visiting the Costa Mesa and Newport Beach area. The gourmet doughnut shop started serving fresh doughnuts in 2013 in Costa Mesa. Since then, they have expanded to different locations in Torrance, Los Angeles and Del Mar. Sidecar Doughnuts specializes in creating the prettiest, thick and densest cake doughnuts that are fried fresh every hour, using the finest and freshest ingredients to create inventive and unique flavors. Their most popular flavor is the Huckleberry doughnut, a cake doughnut that contains fresh berries inside the dough and the glaze. If you're not a fan of fruit flavors, their Butter & Salt doughnut is another popular choice among loyal customers. This one is a rich cake doughnut with a brown butter vanilla glaze and complemented by a sprinkling of sea salt. If you are looking for the best doughnuts in Southern California, then Sidecar Doughnuts is a must-visit.† Melvin Ventura / Daily Nexus 2. Paderia Bakehouse  If you're someone who prefers chocolate chip cookies that are thick and chewy, then Paderia Bakehouse is the place for you. The cookies at Paderia Bakehouse closely resemble the iconic cookies from  in New York City. The cookies are served warm and are slightly underbaked in order to ensure that the center beneath the crisp outer layer of the cookie has a soft and gooey texture that melts in your mouth. They offer multiple different cookie flavors but some standouts are definitely the chocolate walnut and triple chocolate flavors. Not in the mood for a cookie? You could never go wrong with one of Paderia's other signature homemade desserts, such as malasadas, Portuguese egg tarts, cheesecakes and Filipino ensaymadas. Whatever choice you make at Paderia, you're definitely in for an exceptionally delicious treat.† Melvin Ventura / Daily Nexus 3. Vitaly Caff√® Located in the heart of The CAMP, a trendy and artsy outdoor shopping center in Costa Mesa, is Vitaly Caff√®, a gourmet Italian cafe that serves homemade pastas, sandwiches and the best gelato in Orange County. Vitaly offers a variety of different ways to enjoy their gourmet gelato. If you're having trouble deciding on picking just one of their many different flavors, you could opt for a gelato flight which consists of five adorable mini scoops of gelato served on a tray. If you're feeling adventurous you could try one of their sundaes or a gelato burger, a warm, sweet bun filled with two scoops of gelato. There are a lot of options in terms of flavors at Vitaly, but Oreo and strawberry mascarpone are definitely some of the favorites among regular customers. A scoop of gelato is the perfect complement to an ambient stroll through the beautiful and aesthetically pleasing corridors of The CAMP.† Melvin Ventura / Daily Nexus 4. Fill Bakeshop† Mochi doughnuts are definitely a hit or miss because of their unique texture, but Fill Bakeshop does everything right when it comes to them. The base of these flower-shaped beauties has the perfect, chewy mochi texture that has the right balance of soft and tender. Fill stands out from other mochi doughnut shops because of the unique and creative flavors that they offer. They also rotate their menu often, so there is always something new to try. Some of the notable flavors from their current rotation include the strawberry shortcake and Blood Orange Tiger flavors. They also have some classic flavors that will keep you coming back for more, such as cookies and cream and taro. If you're looking to try mochi doughnuts for the first time or form a new opinion on them, you're going to want to make sure that you go to Fill.† Melvin Ventura / Daily Nexus 5. MOULIN† If you're headed to the beach in South OC, MOULIN is a must-try. With an original location in Newport Beach, they have also expanded to Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente. MOULIN is a Parisian style caf√© offering breakfast, lunch, but most importantly î French pastries. Every day, MOULIN serves a variety of classic French patisserie ranging from √©clairs, tartes and mille-feuilles to larger desserts, like one of the most popular: the Tarte Trop√©zienne. This dessert, originating from the southern French city of Saint-Tropez, is made with layers of sweet brioche flavored with orange blossom water, filled with cr√®me diplomate and topped with pearled sugar. They also have amazing croissants (of course) and serve a variety of fresh cr√™pes topped with your choice of Nutella, powdered sugar or fresh fruit. Overall, when in Orange County, MOULIN is the place for authentic French desserts that are just as delicious as they are beautiful.† Elena Aquilanti / Daily Nexus 6. French's Pastry Bakery† With locations in Mission Viejo, Orange and Costa Mesa, wherever you may be in the OC, chances are there's a French's Pastry Bakery nearby. French's is a classic bakery specializing in beautiful cakes, cupcakes and cookies, making it the perfect spot for special-occasion sweets. They are also renowned among the locals for their delicious danishes and pastries, for those of us who don't need an excuse to have dessert for breakfast. But the real gem of French's Bakery is what they call the Wagon Wheel,ù a mouthwatering, party-sized danish that comes in chocolate, raspberry and apple variations. Seriously. To. Die. For. So if you're in the neighborhood, stop by French's to satisfy your sweet tooth!† î As you can see from our list, the dessert scene in Orange County is clearly unmatched. Make sure you stop by these amazing dessert spots to experience the best of what Orange County has to offer.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the February 10, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

I've chosen three different treats î cupcakes, cheesecake bars and cookies î all with different flavors for some variety.† Strawberry Cheesecake Cookie Bars Dominique D'Lima / Daily Nexus These fun and deliciously fruity bars are the easiest to make out of these options. I made mine dairy-free by using Earth Balance and Miyoko's Creamery vegan cream cheese. I topped them with a simple glaze of powdered sugar and a little water in the photo. The original recipe can be found here. I halved the amount of cream cheese topping in my recipe and baked for a little longer. Ingredients: Directions: Rosewater Cupcakes† Instead of roses, you can give out these rose-flavored cupcakes for Valentine's Day. These cupcakes have the perfect amount of floral undertones. Plus, the recipe is vegan (although you wouldn't be able to tell). If you're having trouble finding rosewater extract, I was able to get it at the European Deli Market in Goleta. The original recipe can be found here; I mostly followed it as written but halved the amount of frosting.† Ingredients: For the cake: For the frosting: Directions: Matcha Cookies with Raspberry Glaze Dominique D'Lima / Daily Nexus For this dessert I combined my favorite matcha cookie recipe with a raspberry syrup recipe (that also tastes great in matcha lattes) to add some tang to the earthiness of the matcha. I made the matcha cookies smaller than the original recipe, and they took about 10 minutes to bake. I also omitted the sugar coating in the original matcha cookie recipe since I was adding a glaze. Ingredients:† Directions: î These recipes are the perfect way to show your love this Valentine's Day, or whenever for that matter; I'll be making them year-round.

Red wine is romantic. Why not put the two together this Valentine's Day? Luxurious, rich flavors are always what I look for when cooking for the people I love, and this recipe delivers that without much effort. The secret? A tablespoon of miso. The umami of the miso turns an already delicious dish into an I'm-going-to-lick-the-plate-clean type meal. Risotto has a reputation for being a tough dish to get right, but with a few tricks, it's rather simple.† To make this recipe extra Valentine's day-themed, I'm co-authoring it with my girlfriend, Alice. We cook dinner together as often as we canî it's our way of expressing love for each other at the end of a long, tiring day. A way to make time for the two of us.

On Feb. 2 the cultural resource centers presented their own recipes that result in a quick and easy meal with low-cost ingredients.† Photo courtesy of Kiyan Atrian. The online event was led by fourth-year Kiyan Atrian, of the MENASA CRC and fourth-year Monica Cordova, of the CLCRC. They began by asking the participants two questions to respond to in the Zoom chat: What does food mean to you?ù and What are you eating right now?ù Answers ranged from clam chowder to hummus, and the event leaders described food as a means of expression and cultural connection.ù They segued into encouraging participants to contribute their recipes into their digital cookbook titled Cooking Cultural Food on a Budget!ù which as of Feb. 9 has 10 recipes including enchiladas de pollo con chile verde and Israeli salad.†† Photo courtesy of Kiyan Atrian. Then, Cordova proceeded to do a live demonstration of cooking potato tacos which only involved four ingredients î potatoes, tortillas, cheese and oil î and was quickly made with the aid of a microwave. Afterwards, Atrian presented his two recipes: salad shirazi and most-e-khiar. Both the salad shirazi's and most-e-khiar's ingredients were at an estimated cost of $10 for each plate, and Atrian mentioned that it usually takes him about 10 minutes to prepare both dishes.† Once the demonstrations came to an end, Atrian mentioned that, from his own personal experiences, it can be difficult to find a good restaurant that reflects his culture. He emphasizes that the cookbook is meant for those who are food insecureù or feeling some level of exclusion from Santa Barbara's eateries.

on-the-menu,Decolonizing Our Plates and Reframing the Standards of Health,17-Feb-22,9:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-17/decolonizing-our-plates-and-reframing-the-standards-of-health/,"Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus Why is the epitome of health always depicted as a thin white woman eating a salad? Why can't we shift this image to include people enjoying their cultural foods, honoring their hunger cues, loving their bodies at all stages and not changing every single aspect of their lives to be healthy? While it's something that people don't think about often, the standardsù for healthy eating and living are inherently whitewashed. Creating a more inclusive and diverse space to discuss nutrition can be challenging and requires structural change of many aspects of health and wellness. Additionally, it does not mean that making Oprah Winfrey the spokesperson for Weight Watchers (WW) has ended racism in the wellness industry. We must take a step further than celebrity endorsements and focus on dismantling the decades-old standards for health.† The concept of body mass index (BMI) has been used against Black people to categorize the majority of the Black population as overweight, which, in turn, causes us to demonize their cultural foods. In an article for The Washington Post, Carly Stern notes that the BMI scale was created by, you guessed it, a white guy named Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet around 200 years ago. The scale was created from a sample of white men in order to determine the height and weight of the averageù man. Since the sample used was not nearly diverse enough, the scale does not account for the different body types and set weights of people of color.† Stern's article also dives into the state of the BMI scale today. Fatima Cody Stanford, a physician scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and her team have suggested adjustments to the BMI scale that would accommodate for different body types dependent on racial and ethnic variation.ù By using data from a health examination survey that took place between 1999 and 2016, Stanford determined that BMI cut points, the rationale used to determine the weight zone under which someone falls, are lower for Black, white and Latino men. Thresholds for Black women are higher, but the cut points for Latinas and white women are also lower. There is still much discourse on whether BMI should be modified or eliminated as a measuring tool of health from the healthcare system entirely.† Knowing that white people created these standard measures of health and dominate the medical field, it is no surprise that cultural foods, especially those from Black cultures, are criticized for being òunhealthy.ù Now, Black creators and health professionals are challenging these racist frameworks and changing how we discuss health and wellness in a way that is inclusive for all people.† Courtesy of Kera Nyemb-Diop Dr. Kera Nyemb-Diop, also known as @black.nutritionist on Instagram, empowers the Black community through her nutritionist practice. Nyemb-Diop is a nutrition expert and food activist as well as the founder and CEO of The Black Nutritionist,ù a culturally relevant nutrition platform that empowers Black women on how to better nurture their bodies by letting go of food guilt and shame. The main message behind her social media presence, and her practice, is Decolonize Your Plate.ù In order to decolonize your plate, you have to reject the Eurocentric healthyù foods that are pushed upon us every day and embrace cultural foods that both nourish your body and soul. One of the main issues in the nutrition space is that people of color struggle with finding professionals that look like them or share the same culture. We need more people of color in this space who will not prescribe a nutrition program of kale and green juice but one that is sustainable and tailored to accommodate for many different cultural backgrounds.† We cannot keep pitting cultural foods against Eurocentric food, all while neglecting other inequities that people of color might face such as access to affordable and fresh food. This brings us back to the burning question everyone wants to know: What does health look like? I think the answer is that health can be anything you want it to be. Perhaps the most unhealthy thing to do is to shame others for the foods they grew up with and still love today.†

There's an endless number of vegan accounts, Whole30 accounts, general healthy eatingù accounts and more, to the point that it can be overwhelming. Not only is the space crowded, but it's incredibly white. With that lack of diversity comes a lack of creativity which, in my opinion, is the most enjoyable part of cooking! With that being said, here are some of my favorite Black content creators within the health and wellnessù food space. These creators bring nuance, creativity and fun to a space bogged down by monotony.† † Fit Soul Kitchen Nancy's Fit Soul Kitchen, an account and blog run by Nancy Odogwu, is a great follow, especially if you're plant-based. First of all, Odogwu is a certified nutritional therapist, so you know she actually knows what she's talking about. In a space where everyone and anyone can post whatever, it's nice to find a source you can trust. Throughout the recipe posts, there are also informational posts ranging from topics such as gut health to vegan nutrition guides, among many more.† Beyond her qualifications, her recipes look delicious, easy and most importantly, creative. I find that when I'm trying to eat healthier, I tend to fall into a rut of uncreative, uninspired cooking, which eventually leads to me breaking the trend and ordering Wingstop. Odogwu's recipes, like her Vegan Lentil and Plantain Pie, Stuffed Plantain Boats or Okra Stir Fried with Bulgur Wheat, will keep you inspired and well-nourished. There are plenty of great recipes here to spice up your healthy diet in creative ways. † Clean Foodie Cravings Clean Foodie Cravings, run by Charlotte Smythe, is another fun account to follow. Many of her recipes are keto, low-carb or Whole30, so if you're following one of those diets, this account will be really helpful. She's also the author of One-Pot Keto Cooking: 75 Delicious Low-Carb Meals for the Busy Cook,ù an awesome cookbook especially for college students like us, who want something easy, delicious and relatively mess-free for dinner. Smythe publishes simple, healthy recipes like her Instant Pot Liberian Inspired Pepper Chicken and Simple Keto Brown Sugar Glazed Salmon Dinner. She'll introduce you to so many beautiful, simple, feel-good recipes to build up your healthy cooking repertoire.† My favorite part about following Smythe, though, is her personality. It's hard to feel connected to a blogger through their Instagram posts; A lot of the time, I feel like I'm scrolling through the page of a nutritionally-responsible robot rather than a real person. Smythe has an awesome personality that seems to come off effortlessly in her posts, whether it be the sounds she uses in her videos or the occasional, funny post where she's just chatting. She's such a funny, charismatic person, it's hard not to get stuck on her page for a while. † Murielle Banackissa I have to include Murielle Banackissa on this list, if not for her beautiful photography alone. Seriously, go to her page and tell me her pictures aren't breathtaking. They're such an inspiration, especially to somebody in the food content creation space like myself. Banackissa, while not overtly a health food blogger,ù publishes many healthy recipes or veganizes dessert foods to make them a little healthier. Listen, I don't have to justify her place on this page î it's well deserved on artistry alone and deserves a follow, especially if you're a creative yourself.† Banackissa's Tip Thursdaysù series is another fantastic reason to follow her. Tip Thursdaysù is where she gives advice on food photography, plating and many other aspects of food creativity. I was so, so glad to see she was doing a series like this after scrolling through her page, envious of her talent with photography. Please check out Banackissa's account, learn a couple of delicious recipes and become a more artistic cook. And if you're interested in food photography, check out her YouTube channel (just her full name!) for more in-depth, tutorial-based content.† † While these three creators are an awesome starting point, please continue to explore the field! Diversity is the most fundamental tenet in the food industry: diversity in flavors, ingredients, techniques and perspectives. Pop onto the Followingù section of any of their Instagram pages and you'll find tens, if not hundreds, of new accounts from diverse, talented perspectives waiting to share their delicious food with you.† A version of this article appeared on page 10 of the February 17, 2022 edition of the Daily Nexus.†

It is filled with great restaurants for every kind of foodie out there. I, for one, love Italian and had to try out Pascucci when I heard about it.† The bright white Spanish arcs illuminated by warm, yellow lights invite you into the restaurant. You are greeted by wonderfully smiling faces and offered a table indoors or outdoors. My guest and I decided to bask in the heat of the fire and enjoy the brilliant colors of the Santa Barbara nightlife that surrounded us. However, do not let the sounds of the bustling street and other restaurants discourage you from sitting outside. Pascucci is located on the corner of W Haley Street and State Street. Therefore, it offers a sense of quiet peacefulness that is great for conversations. I suppose since the title of this section is On the Menu,ù we should talk a bit about the menu. First, for us carb lovers, this menu offered everything and more. It had the basics, like fettuccine alfredo and spaghetti with bolognese, to the authentic Italian dishes, like Risotto Toscano. The wine list wasn't exhaustive, but the rich reds and light whites were more than great pairings with the pasta options.† Gabby Trachsel / Daily Nexus We started with an order of the bruschetta because how could you not, and a regular-sized Cobb salad split in half. We were surprised to see that each dish was huge! It made us feel like we may not even have had the room for the main course. We ordered the San Marco ravioli with portobello mushrooms and a mushroom cream sauce, along with the Shrimp Piccata. The flavors were exactly what you would imagine: buttery and tangy, delicate yet sharp and all amazing. By the time the bill had come, we were stuffed. To our surprise, the prices, unlike most nice Italian places, were suitable for those with a champagne taste on a beer budget. Gabby Traschel / Daily Nexus If you are out with friends, on a romantic date or just really craving some pasta but don't want to make it yourself, Santa Barbara's Pascucci is the place to be.††

A quick workout in the gym is nearly impossible, with the racks and free weights swarmed by students nonstop from 6 a.m. in the morning to 11 p.m. at night.† But, even if you go hard on cardio and lifting, it won't mean as much unless you double down on your diet. Most people know that consuming protein is important to gaining muscle, but it's hard to conceptualize exactly how much protein is necessary for athletes.† Many registered dietitians, including UCSB's exercise and sports studies professor Amy Jamieson, recommend that athletes consume about 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per 1 kilogram of body mass. For most people, that means their protein intake per meal (if you consume about four meals a day) should hover between 20 to 35 grams. For comparison, the average sedentary human requires only about 46 to 56 grams of protein per day.† Notably, it's smart to eat a variety of protein sources to ensure intake of all nine essential amino acids, which are vital to building muscle in the body. I'm looking at you, protein-shake fanatics. Complementary combinations of protein-rich foods are particularly important for vegetarians, as meatless diets often lack high-quality proteins. But, while omnivores might have the upper hand for lunch and dinner, most individuals still struggle to pack protein into their breakfasts. I mean, no one wants to eat chicken breast and beans at 8 o'clock in the morning.† With some strategic cooking, though, hitting your protein goal at any time of the day becomes easy. Try upgrading your breakfasts with some of these high-protein recipes:† Protein Waffles† (23 grams of protein per serving; makes 3 servings). Ingredients Directions † Spinach and Feta Egg Muffins (20 grams of protein per serving; makes 4 servings) Ingredients Directions † Peanut Butter Overnight Oats (24 grams of protein per serving; makes 1 serving) Ingredients Directions Every athlete can benefit from proper protein consumption, and any athlete can use strategic cooking to reach their goals!

Popularized by Western media in the award-winning 1991 film by the same name (based on the 1987 novel by Fannie Flagg), fried green tomatoes have been thought to be a staple in the American South for years. The earliest recipes for the dish were dated between 1900 and 1919, surprisingly all from newspapers in northern states.† Interestingly enough, the Alabama cafe on which the fictional Fried Green Tomatoesù was based had no history of serving fried green tomatoes, other than perhaps an occasional side item. It turns out that the origins of this delicacy are in the Midwest and Northeast, assumed to be linked with Jewish immigrants, due to a recipe appearing in The International Jewish Cook Bookù in 1919.†† Unexpected origin story aside, fried green tomatoes are a quick and tasty side dish, incorporating a nutritious, immunity-boosting vegetable! Ingredients: Instructions:  This ended up being a relatively easy and satisfying side dish! It's certainly an acquired taste, but I look forward to experimenting some more.†

on-the-menu,Two Recipes for Mardi Gras,1-Mar-22,8:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-01/two-recipes-for-mardi-gras/,"This year on March 1, Fat Tuesday, also known as Mardi Gras or Shrove Tuesday, marks the last day before the Lenten season begins. For Catholics, this 46 day period (40 days observed, Sundays are excluded) before Easter is a time of fasting, prayer and almsgiving. Catholics often choose to give up particular indulgences during Lent, like chocolate or soda, as a form of fasting. So it's not too surprising that the last day of freedom before the start of Lent goes by the moniker Fat Tuesday.ù Arguably, no one does Fat Tuesday celebrations like the South. Rather than lasting just one day, Carnival takes up the entire season between the Epiphany (Jan. 6 this year) and Ash Wednesday (March 2 this year), with the culmination landing on the last day. In Louisiana, Mardi Gras is even a legal holiday! Though Chancellor Henry T. Yang has not similarly gifted UC Santa Barbara students the day off, you can still mimic some quintessential Mardi Gras recipes to make the day a little sweeter.† Representing the perfect combination of savory, spicy and sweet, jambalaya and beignets are my go-to Fat Tuesday dishes. Unfortunately, traditional jambalaya and beignets require specialized ingredients that most college students don't own, like Worcestershire sauce, okra, bread flour and condensed milk. To make these festive dishes more wallet-friendly and convenient, I adapted two traditional jambalaya and beignet recipes below.

With its casual setting and convenient location, it's the perfect spot to grab a coffee, tea or pastry. Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus United States of Espresso, also known as USofE, is an Australian-based coffee company specializing in espresso drinks, pastries and toasts. The food truck originated in Venice Beach, which is currently its only other location. According to their website, the name United States of Espressoù comes from their mission to bring espresso culture to local communities across the United States and unite coffee lovers.ù The baristas, Kevin and Aivarey, told me that USofE will be a permanent fixture in Isla Vista and that they are here for the long haul.ù The menu features their specialty, espresso, as well as a variety of espresso drinks î lattes, cappuccinos, flat whites and more. In addition to coffee, they also serve tea, hot chocolate, chai, matcha lattes and turmeric lattes. If you're looking for food, try one of their pastries, their avocado toast or Aussie-inspired Vegemite toast.† Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus I decided on an iced latte and a cream cheese danish. The cream cheese danish ($4.25) was rich and sweet ì the perfect indulgent pastry. I also thought the latte was delicious, with a full body and smooth flavor, as well as notes of fruitiness and acidity. This comes from their signature blend of ethically sourced espresso beans which are handcrafted to highlight the natural qualities of espresso.ù Although a bit expensive ($5.75 for a plain iced latte), the high quality of the espresso makes it worth the price. According to Aivarey, they say not all good coffee is espresso, but all espresso is good coffee.ù They definitely live up to their motto!† So next time you're craving an aromatic espresso or a homemade pastry, stop by United States of Espresso! They're in Isla Vista Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., and you can keep track of any updates by following their Instagram, @ivcoffeetruck.

on-the-menu,Kyle's Chicken House: Bringing Fried Chicken to Isla Vista,3-Mar-22,10:15 AM,['Michelle Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-03/kyles-chicken-house-bringing-fried-chicken-to-isla-vista-2/,"Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus Nestled on the corner of Embarcadero del Mar and Pardall Road lies one of Isla Vista's newer food establishments: Kyle's Chicken House. The latest addition to the Kyle's Restaurant Family, Kyle's Chicken House differs from its sister restaurant, Kyle's Kitchen, by offering a menu that revolves around fried chicken. This restaurant concept originated from the success of a single menu item at Kyle's Kitchen, the Krispy Chicken Sandwich.† Fast forward to 2021, when the chicken sandwich wars were going on, we introduced in Kyle's Kitchen a chicken sandwich [which] immediately shot to the top of our sales charts,ù said Michael Kling, general manager of Kyle's Chicken House Isla Vista and Kyle's Kitchen's Hollister Avenue location. That gave [us] the idea to pivot into something really hot and really popular, especially with kids.ù The menu at Kyle's Chicken House consists of chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches î both of which can be ordered in either original or Nashville Hot î as the main dishes, and Krinkle Cut fries and Texas Toast as sides. Diners can also pick from a wide range of sauces to complement their meal, from buffalo ranch to sweet chili. While the restaurant has a relatively simple menu, according to Kling, the chicken tenders at Kyle's Chicken House are prepared using a special method that sets them apart from other fried chicken establishments.† Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus What makes us different from other chicken places is our pressure fryer,ù said Kling. The pressure fryer is great because instead of cooking from the outside in, which is kind of the regular way, a pressure fryer builds up a tremendous pressure inside the chamber and cooks from the inside out. And that's why our chicken is so juicy.ù In addition to adopting a unique method to cooking their chicken, Kyle's Chicken House gave a twist to the classic Nashville hot chicken sandwich, one of their best-selling items alongside the three-piece tender meal.† Nashville hot is more of a flavor than an indication of spiciness,ù explained Kling. Our [Nashville hot] is a dry seasoning made with dehydrated sunflower oil, so when you take the fresh chicken right out of the pressure fryer and apply the dry seasoning, it rehydrates from the warmth and the residual oil from frying and coats [the chicken] like a sauce.ù† Novel culinary techniques aside, what truly makes Kyle's Chicken House unique is its commitment to philanthropy, a trait that is shared by all Kyle's brand restaurants as part of their ongoing mission to improve the lives of people with special needs in the communities they serve. As such, a portion of all of Kyle's Chicken House's profits will be donated to the Kyle's Kitchen Special Needs Giving Back Program, which to date has donated $200,000 to over 30 organizations that support special needs efforts.† Watch the full menu review of Kyle's Chicken House here.

Since getting together, she's taught me a lot about Ukrainian culture, cuisine in particular. I'm a huge fan of sour, salty flavors, so I immediately took to Ukrainian cooking, and solyanka, a traditional Ukrainian soup, is the perfect example of everything I love about Ukrainian cuisine. Coming from the word sil,ù which means salt, solyanka utilizes pickled products and their brine to give the soup a delicious salty, sour kick. I think of it as the Ukrainian parallel to kimchi-jjigae, one of my favorite foods of all time. After the first spoonful, this soup shot to the top of my favorite soupsù list.† While you can use any type of meat for solyanka, it's traditional to use a combination of cured and boiled meats. It's meant to be a pantry cleaner, so use whatever you have lying around. For this recipe, we only used cured meats î a hard evreyskaya (dry salami), and a softer buterbrodnaya (smoked, cooked salami).† Alice Bilyk / Daily Nexus Ingredients: Directions: î Solyanka is easy, cheap and comes together super fast. Plus, it's delicious. Ukraine is a wonderful country with a beautiful culture; please don't let it be defined only by its conflicts with Russia.

Even though I'm a Bay Area native, my family has spent a lot of time in the area over the past few years and frequent trips to this coastal town have helped me get a sense of the local food scene.† Much like Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz has a relaxed vibe that translates into the food it has to offer.† For Breakfast and Coffee:† If you're in the Capitola area, you must try handmade cannolis from the one and only S.C. Bread Boy. Easily recognizable by his signature white Vespa that he parks at various locations around Santa Cruz, Lance sells cannolis and focaccia nearly every weekend right next to the water. Follow his Instagram to see what flavors he is selling and where to find him! Be sure to get there early î he sells out quickly! Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus For coffee beverages, pastries and avocado toast, Cat and Cloud is also a great option. Also located in the Capitola area, this neighborhood coffee shop offers one of the best chai lattes I've had and delicious, freshly baked scones. For Lunch:† While the majority of these featured eateries are located in the heart of Santa Cruz, prepare to spend some time driving if you plan on visiting the Humble Sea Brewing Co. in Felton. Felton is a charming town located on State Route 9, just twenty minutes north of Santa Cruz. Humble Sea Brewing Co. is a new establishment in Santa Cruz County and offers brunch, lunch and dinner. While their Fried Chicken Sandwich is nothing spectacular, I recommend trying the Mushroom Melt which is served with a lovely dipping broth. I'm dairy-free, but this sandwich is totally worth taking a Lactaid pill. Humble Sea is known for their brewery, but they also have great mocktails.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus For a more casual option near the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, visit The Picnic Basket for lunch. I'm a huge fan of their Beet Sandwich, which is a more mature take on a PB&J. In between the bread are thick slices of beets, spinach, coarse-ground almond butter and chickpeas.† For Dinner:† S√ºda is the perfect place for a date night. While the restaurant is along a busy road in Capitola, its outside courtyard is cozy and intimate. I recommend their Ahi Poke Bowl. Sure, ordering a poke bowl is boring, but I am not exaggerating when I say that this poke is worth the full $17. The ingredients are so fresh and the thin slices of daikon radish and spicy aioli truly elevate the bowl. I'm dying to try the Squid Ink Pasta during my next visit.† Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus For a more laid-back dinner downtown, go to Cafe Gratitude. Cafe Gratitude is an entirely vegan restaurant that uses seasonal and local ingredients. If you're a fan of hearty grain bowls and a veggie-lover, you'll love Cafe Gratitude. I really enjoy their Pan Seared Polenta.† For Dessert:† This list would not be complete without a dessert recommendation! If you didn't stock up on cannolis from the S.C. Bread Boy that morning, don't fret! The Penny Ice Creamery is open until 11 p.m. to satisfy all your ice cream cravings. For my lactose-intolerant folks, I love their chocolate sorbet with toasted marshmallow topping. The marshmallow topping is an optional add-on, but in my book, it's totally necessary. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Santa Cruz might look like any other beach town, but its eateries are unique and place an emphasis on local ingredients and distinctive flavors. Now that you're equipped with my master list of Santa Cruz food recommendations, it's time for a road trip up the California coast!

on-the-menu,Rascal's: Delicious Vegan Food Downtown,31-Mar-22,9:26 AM,['Alice Bilyk'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-31/rascals-delicious-vegan-food-downtown/,"Alice Bilyk / Daily Nexus So, I'm not technically vegan ì I meeaan, I try to shop vegan for environmental reasons and limit my animal product consumption (which I think we should all try to do if we can, but that's a different article), but, when not buying groceries, I eat pretty much everything. However, one of my close friends is vegan and another is vegetarian, so we try a lot of different vegan options and restaurants around Santa Barbara. Last year, we heard of this little pop-up that makes vegan Mexican and fast food and had to try it! The first time I visited, and every visit since, has been magical from start to finish. First of all, the atmosphere! It's located out of this beautiful lofty space on 18 E Cota Street, right by Palace and Foxtail. Venus in Furs was formerly a bar owned by The Good Lion company that operated out of the location, but is now exclusively occupied by Rascal's. It feels like an elegant jungle garden ì the definition of curated good vibes.† Let's talk about the food! Rascal's has a 100% vegan menu they update fairly frequently, and they're good about offering and labeling gluten-free options. The restaurant is open five days a week from Wednesday to Sunday. As of March 18, 2022, they offer a large selection of vegan Mexican dishes from Wednesday to Saturday. Their tortillas and chips are made from scratch and are honestly some of the most delicious I've ever had.† Alice Bilyk / Daily Nexus They currently offer the chips and salsa, wheat chicharrones and spicy elote (topped with Taki's, veganaise, almond parm and cilantro) as small plates. For tacos, they offer the rajas tacos (grilled pasilla peppers with onions and vegan cheese), impossible picadillo tacos (impossible meat infused with guajillo, with carrots and potatoes), and the al pastor tacos (seitan and fresh pineapple with cilantro, onion and lime). In addition to tacos, the menu features two bowls ì one salad option (greens, bell pepper, potatoes, quinoa, tomatoes and tofu) and an oyster mushroom and pinto bean bowl (along with cilantro, radish and lime). Their main dishes include asada sopes (cheese, refried pinto beans, asada, lettuce, tofu cheese, cashew crema), tempeh torta (tempeh with chipotle aioli, lettuce and tomato on a telera roll) and the chicken burrito (seitan chicken, beans, spanish rice and pico de gallo). For dessert, they currently have a lemon cheesecake. They also offer a variety of agua frescas and soft drinks. Additionally, price-wise, I wouldn't call them expensive. Small plates run from $6-8, everything else ranges from $12-16, and the portions are generous.† On Sundays, they serve their Burgertown menu, which mainly consists of waffle fries, a cheeseburger and their weekly milkshake flavor. Will note, their waffle fries are just so delicious, I don't know how they do it; my partner is gluten intolerant, so the only thing on the Burgertown menu that he can have is the waffle fries ì they were more than enough to call it a successful outing.† From this current selection, my friends and I have tried the chips and salsa, rajas tacos, al pastor tacos, asada sopes, specialty crunchwrap and Burgertown menu. We've marveled at their ability to so closely replicate the taste and feel of meat, especially in dishes like the asada sopes and crunchwrap, in addition to just how delicious the food always is. No matter what's on the menu, we know everything will taste great. From past menus, we've enjoyed delicious combinations like hibiscus flautas, blue corn potato tacos and chicharron chile verde tacos with nopales. I'm already dreaming of coming back, even though I was just there this weekend!† Rascals† frequently does pop-up collaborations with other small establishments, such as Low Pigeon (@lowpigeon), Muni Wine (@muniwine), GoodStuffBakedTreats (@eatgoodstuffeveryday) and Coastal Coffee Collaborative (@coastalcoffeecollaborative), and offer specialty menu items, such as their vegan crunchwrap, vegan pizza, or their occasional Sunday Brunch menu. I'm super glad that they're putting a ton of effort into strengthening the relationships with other local small businesses since it creates a unique community of businesses with meaningful connections to this area! Restaurants and businesses coming together to collaborate is always, in my eyes, an indicator of a thriving local food scene. They publicize their events and menus on their Instagram (@rascals_sb). They also recently started offering delivery on Grubhub!† For someone like me who loves cooking, I sometimes feel as though restaurants in Santa Barbara are overpriced for something you can just make at home. Part of the magic at Rascal's is that all the dishes are so deliciously indulgent that it never crosses your mind that they're vegan substitutes, and I don't think their food is something you can easily replicate at home.† In the past, Rascals, The Good Lion company and Barbare√±o collaborated to split the rent of this space, running Barb's Pies, the Venus in Furs bar and Rascal's out of one location. However, since then, Barbareno dropped out, followed later by Venus in Furs. Now, the space is exclusively Rascal's, and they're fighting hard to be able to keep it. If I can recommend any restaurant in Santa Barbara, or go anywhere on a night out, it would be Rascal's. The food is made with heart and talent, is always delicious, all while set in a gorgeous space.† A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the March 31, 2022 edition of the Daily Nexus.†

Well, I'm here to tell you that I've done the search for you. Many lattes, baked goods and study sessions later î I have for you, the most well-known coffee spots near UCSB (in chronological order of the date of my visit) and my thoughts on each of them.† Bagel Cafe Hear me out ¶ Bagel Cafe has the best food in Isla Vista. The aroma that surrounds my apartment around 11 p.m. as the kitchen staff prepare the next morning's bagels is the most heavenly scent I've ever smelled.† However ¶ Bagel Cafe was also where I purchased my first ever cup of coffee as a UCSB student. I was determined to live a main character moment my first morning waking up at UCSB, so I decided to go on a walk to a coffee shop. The closest one to my dorm? Bagel Cafe. I had my cute, little walk by the lagoon and arrived to order what I'm sure was an iced vanilla latte with almond milk. An unbearably watery sip, unfortunately, found me extremely disappointed. And so, with a heavy heart, I returned to my dorm room and vowed to never again drink a coffee from Bagel Cafe.† Though, if you're interested in a nice snack for a morning study session, grab a bagel, and bring your hotspot to finish up that paper at Little Acorn Park.† Starbucks The classic. This was probably the second coffee spot I ever went to. I won't talk about the coffee itself too much except to say that you and I both know there's much better coffee elsewhere (I say, with 400 stars waiting for me in my app).† The UCen Starbucks is a great option in a pinch, especially either on the way to the library or before studying at the abundance of tables in the UCen itself. And the one in I.V.? A great outdoor spot to listen to the mild chatter of I.V. as you work under the Starbucks' Wi-Fi with your friends. Plus, if you're a snacky studier like myself, you're surrounded by an abundance of restaurants. Caj√© Coffee Roasters Caj√© is another I.V. classic. It was my introduction to lavender lattes and, for that, I am eternally grateful. And an insider/barista secret? Caj√©'s lattes only have two shots of espresso, for both small and large î skip the extra dollar it costs to size up. Their The Worksù bagel is a fan favorite (and by fan, I mean myself). As good as Caj√© is, it is a bit expensive for those of us still working minimum wage jobs. If you have an extra couple, or let's be real, seven dollars to spare, I highly recommend a large lavender oat milk latte with an extra shot of espresso.† I have never, however, tried to study at Caj√©, and I'm not sure that I ever will. I study so much better in a relatively quiet area, and the ever flowing hustle and bustle of Caj√© is simply not conducive to that. However, I know many people who love Caj√© for a study session, so maybe give it a shot if your focus is a bit better than mine. Old Town Coffee Old Town Coffee was my first adventure outside the streets of Isla Vista for coffee (shoutout to my car). The environment is perfect for studying; a nice amount of chatter without being too overwhelming. I went with a group, and we found a cute table inside to work at.† At Old Town, I ordered a rose latte because they were out of my previously proclaimed favorite î lavender. This was a barista recommendation, and let me tell you î not my cup of tea, or coffee rather. The quality of the latte itself was good, but the rose flavoring was not for me. Old Town Coffee has a selection of pastries as well. I ordered the poppy seed twist which served as a great satisfaction to my study cravings.† Dune† Dune is Santa Barbara's pride and joy î and in all honesty, I'm not sure why. It's a cute, little place to grab a snack, but nothing special in my opinion. On my first visit, I ordered the Iced Tres Leches latte, which proved to be a pretty standard, flavorless latte. I haven't studied at Dune yet, but from my view of the one across from Target, it doesn't seem the most conducive to studying.† Santa Barbara Roasting Company The furthest drive of the bunch but arguably worth it. I went on a Sunday afternoon with a group of friends with plans to study. While our study plans did not pan out as we had intended (we met a very chatty lady who talked to us the whole time we were there), I see how the vibes were quite conducive to a Sunday study moment. My hunger was met with their veggie toastù whose name does not lend itself nearly enough to the deliciousness that I ate, and my caffeine cravings were satisfied by a quad shot î yes, quad shot î espresso over ice. I suppose that doesn't allow me to tell you the quality of their coffee menu, but my study buddies were satisfied with their orders as well.† Dean: a coffee shop Sophia Lovell / Daily Nexus I became a Dean regular this past finals week. In fact, it's where I'm writing this article! This may just be my favorite option of them all, so much so that I'm hesitant to include it in this article out of fear of giving away my secret spot. But I wouldn't do that to you; instead, I'll share. The iced quad shot lavender latte with oat milk is one of the best coffees I've ever had. I met the sweetest barista, who complimented my tote, and we had an in depth conversation about our shared love of goat cheese. This isn't as weird as it sounds as I also ordered the date with a goat toast,ù which is another highly recommended order. The vibe of Dean is bright, airy, fresh and clean î perfect to clear your mind for studying. They have outlets at some of the booths, although those spots fill up quickly. But in anticipation of this, Dean offers portable chargers for their customers!† Lighthouse Coffee Lighthouse was highly recommended to me, and I see why. The vibes were very cute and beachy, but not my favorite. The coffee was good, and I ordered a lox bagel which was to die for. However, I don't think I'll be returning for a study session any time soon. The benches to sit at weren't the most comfortable, and the environment just wasn't giving what I needed it to. I think this would be a good spot to study for a study group where you truly don't plan to get too much done. We all have those moments, and I feel like Lighthouse may be perfect for it.† No matter where you go, Goleta and Santa Barbara are home to many great coffee options. That being said, I hope to see many of you at Dean on my frequent visits. Happy caffeinating!†

on-the-menu,Zaytoon: Lebanese Cuisine Downtown,10-Apr-22,12:24 PM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-10/zaytoon-lebanese-cuisine-downtown/,"Celine Pun / Daily Nexus If you are looking for a fairy tale ambiance for an intimate celebration of surviving another chaotic quarter, check out Zaytoon, a Lebanese restaurant on 209 E. Canon Perdido St. in downtown Santa Barbara. There is street parking and a parking lot across the street. My co-worker, who recommended this spot, raved about the food and fire pits, which are unfortunately reserved for parties of four or more. Reservations are highly recommended.† I was not disappointed. Upon my arrival, my kindred spirit and I were greeted by a stunning outdoor display of fairy lights, a blue-lit fountain and low music. The sight was breathtaking. On their website, they recommended bringing outerwear and blankets, but despite Santa Barbara's cold nights, there were enough heat lamps and fire to ward off the cold.† The drinks menu was quite impressive, ranging from 2 ounces of wine that was the cost of a Nintendo Switch ($300) to $6 tea. The cocktails sounded phenomenal, such as a Watermelon Crush and a Mezza Mule, but as it was a Tuesday night during dead week, we went with water and milk oolong, which came with an adorable jar of honey and a cute, loose leaf teapot.† We ordered two dishes and two desserts for the table to share. The Heirloom Greek salad was a feast. The juiciest and most colorful heirloom tomatoes and bright cucumbers were chopped chunkily with crumbly feta, olives, thinly sliced bell peppers and onions. The feta was the mildest feta I ever had, which I absolutely prefer over the pungent ones I get from the store. The loudest flavor came from the olives, with their very classic perfume-y and sharp taste. I thought the dressing was light, slightly tangy and brought out the beautiful simplicity of the vegetables while also reducing the natural spiciness of the onions. Although the individual vegetables were impressively presented, overall, the vegetable ratio was the most disappointing î we would have appreciated more basil.† Next, we ordered the Kebab Combo, which came with rice pilaf, fattoush salad, a generous scoop of toum and pita bread, as our entree. The toum was addicting and had the most perfect slap of garlic. The pita bread was more like pita chips† î† very crispy and dry. The Kebab Combo had the most succulent and tender meat that melted with every bite. I would love to enjoy this again.† We ended the night by spending a hot minute deciding what dessert to get, but we ended up choosing both the gluten-free chocolate cake and the baklava. The chocolate cake was fudgy and served with a scoop of McConnell's sweet cream ice cream, which had a bright, cold flavor that worked so well. But, the mint decor felt wasteful and did not really compliment the rich chocolate or creaminess of the ice cream. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus The baklava had a stunning cross-section î I loved the presentation and layers. It was perfectly moist and sweet but not sticky. However, whipped cream, mint and baklava were a strange combination, and I would prefer to eat baklava by itself next time. Between the two of us, we spent about $90 excluding tips. It was worth every penny. We took home lots of leftovers, and I hope to come back again to bask by the fire pit. A version of this article appeared in the April 7 version of the Daily Nexus

on-the-menu,bouchon: A High Dining Experience,14-Apr-22,9:00 AM,['Sarah Hamidi'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-14/bouchon-a-high-dining-experience/,"Sarah Hamidi / Daily Nexus A high-end Californian restaurant using French culinary techniques, bouchon Santa Barbara is located in the historic Art District on Victoria Street in downtown Santa Barbara. Opened in 1998, the restaurant prides itself on great, local ingredients from the Santa Barbara Farmers' Market and local Santa Barbara-made wine.† They feature a great menu with seasonal items. For this season's items, the first courses include Cauliflower Pur√©e, Warm Pecan & Goat Cheese Tart, òSalade Lyonnaise', Seared Pork Belly and a Trio of Sea Scallops. For the seasonal mains, they offer a Lobster Pot Pieù and a Cabernet-Braised Short Rib. And finally, for the seasonal dessert, they serve a delicious òSticky Toffee' Pecan-Date Cake. The restaurant's signature items include the Maple-Glazed Duck Breast & Confit of Thigh served with a maple glaze and a succotash of butternut squash, corn, leeks and fava beans. Another signature item at the restaurant is the Char-Grilled Rack of Lamb served with herb risotto, sauteed mushrooms and kale with a porcini jus. The service at bouchon is one of the highlights of the restaurant. My friends and I were welcomed with open arms by a host and we took one of the outdoor tables. Our waiter was also incredibly nice and friendly. For our first courses, my friends and I ordered the Trio of Sea Scallops and the Dungeness Crab Cakes. We asked our waiter if this will be enough food for the six of us and they recommended that we order another appetizer. At the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered a third appetizer called Forest Mushroom Ragout.  Our waiter also recommended a great wine pairing with our food, the Margerum òM5', a local pinot noir wine from Santa Barbara. My friend ordered the wine since she wanted a glass of wine with her food and told me she really enjoyed the pinot noir and that the wine choice complemented the food very well. For our main dishes, we then decided to go with the signature duck breast and confit and another seasonal item, the Lobster Pot Pie.ù Sarah Hamidi / Daily Nexus The Trio of Sea Scallops consisted of scallops served in three different ways. The first scallop is a carpaccio, which is a thinly sliced raw scallop, served with cucumbers, orange and citrus segments with chopped red onions topped with watercress. The second scallop is a seared scallop served with sauteed fava beans and mushrooms. The third and final scallop is also a seared scallop served on a bed of paella-flavored risotto with chorizo and asparagus. The Dungeness Crab Cakes were served on a bed of shaved fennel topped with a delicious citrus vinaigrette and fris√©e salad. The Forest Mushroom Ragout, consisting of sauteed mushrooms served with two small slices of grilled cheese, sat on a bed of pureed spinach. So simple, yet so good. Our first courses made us excited for our main courses. The signature pan-seared duck breast was juicy and tender. The sweetness of the succotash compliments the savoriness of the duck perfectly with the maple glaze, providing a hint of sweetness and adding smokiness to the dish. I then had their Lobster Pot Pie and was disappointed that I missed the pieces of lobster in the pot pie because my friends were able to get the pieces and I just didn't get to that dish fast enough. I was still able to taste the mushroom velout√©, and the side salad of arugula provided a nice freshness in my mouth, contrasting the piping hot pot pie. Adding the Madeira creme after cutting open the puff pastry on top of the pot pie made the velout√© much more flavorful and creamier. After delicious meals from the first courses and mains, I decided I wanted to try a dessert to get the full experience. Two of my other friends and I grabbed a creme brulee, a classic French dessert of cooked custard topped with caramelized sugar. Creme bruleeù translated into English means burnt cream.ù Sarah Hamidi / Daily Nexus Our creme brulee was also topped with fresh raspberries and blueberries, reminding me of my childhood and how my dad would make it at home. The custard was cooked perfectly and I got that crack when you put your spoon in the caramelized sugar. The fruits add a hint of acidity and freshness with the cooked custard and sugar. It was a perfectly balanced bite. Overall, our experience at bouchon was amazing and this is indeed one of Santa Barbara's best restaurants. This is the ideal restaurant to bring your date, family or friends to indulge a bit and enjoy a unique dining experience. All of the meals I ordered were delicious in their own way. For the price that you're paying, it is definitely a worthwhile experience. A version of this article appeared on page 14 of the April 14, 2022 version of the Daily Nexus.†
Print Bouchon is a nice dining experience. But the menu almost never changes, so the seasonalù interpretation is not so seasonalù.

on-the-menu,Say Cheese!ù Vegan Cheese Alternatives at the I.V. Food Co-op,14-Apr-22,9:00 AM,"['Yuriko Chavez', 'Haydin Zogaric']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-14/say-cheese-vegan-cheese-alternatives-at-the-i-v-food-co-op/,"Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus In recent years, vegan fare has been taking over the culinary world.† From Impossible meat to various milk substitutes, plant-based food products are on the rise. To most non-vegans, these meat and dairy alternatives may seem unnecessary, or perhaps even intimidating. However, switching to vegan alternatives is beneficial in numerous ways; it's healthy, environmentally friendly and prevents animal harm. On April 6th, the Isla Vista Food Cooperative hosted a vegan cheese tasting for vegans and non-vegans alike.† Allison Baymiller, the marketing and outreach manager of the I.V. Food Co-op, as well as a UC Santa Barbara alumna, led the event. She stated that the reason the Co-op decided to promote vegan cheeses instead of dairy cheeses is because of the variable environmental impact where there's a really high land and water usage associated with sustainable dairy cow raising.ù Vegan cheese is most often made from cashews, which provides a creamy, nutty taste, and is fermented to simulate the sharp, aged flavor of dairy cheese. She elaborated on the positive environmental impact of vegan cheese, while also acknowledging that cheeses made from nuts can also have a large water-consumption and issues with fair trade. There's some of that to consider as well with environmental and social impact,ù Baymiller said. But there's still a lot less animal use associated with vegan cheese.ù† Yuriko Chavez, second-year Chicano studies major, and Haydin Zogaric, first-year political science and global studies double major, tried the Co-op's assortment of vegan cheeses so you don't have to î but you'll definitely want to.†† Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus Nuts for Cheese Super Blue Cheese ($8.99)† The I.V. Food Co-op is currently highlighting Nuts for Cheese, a UK-based vegan cheese company specializing in artisanal, dairy-free cheeses. First on the list is their Super Blueù cheese î a semi-firm wedge of aromatic bleu cheese layered with spirulina, or blue algae, to create that classic blue look.† Y: Blue cheese is actually one of my favorite cheeses! Admittedly, I was a little bit skeptical if vegan cheese could completely capture its thick crumbly character and sharp aftertaste. However, I was so pleasantly surprised that Super Blueù was rich, creamy, aromatic and had a nice pungent punch reminiscent of that strong classic blue cheese aftertaste. The main component that differed from dairy cheese was that it wasn't as crumbly, instead taking on a similar consistency to a hummus spread. Rating: 5/5 H: Although blue cheese is not my personal favorite, I enjoyed trying this cheese and would recommend it to those hesitant toward eating the penicillium, or edible mold, on blue cheese made with dairy. Super Blueù is exactly what I would expect from a blue cheese, from the distinct pungency to the creamy texture. It would be a good substitute for blue cheese in any traditional recipe, such as a fresh Cobb salad or a creamy blue cheese dressing or dip. Rating: 2/5 † Nuts for Cheese Black Garlic Cheese ($8.99)† The Black Garlicù flavor from Nuts for Cheese is an earthy, garlicky semi-firm wedge with an activated charcoal rind. Y: As an avid lover of garlic, I was most excited for this cheese. Though it maintained a rich and creamy texture with some subtle hints of garlic, I was not a huge fan of this cheese. The flavors were a little too subtle. I could see it working better as an addition to other ingredients and flavors. Rating: 2/5 H: I could have eaten the entire wedge of this cheese! It has a perfect amount of tanginess and a super creamy texture. The activated charcoal adds a unique, smoky depth to the cheese. However, as an enthusiastic garlic lover, I agreed that they could definitely amp up the garlic flavor. This cheese paired well with the crispy, crunchy, seed-filled Mary's Gone Crackers,ù also sold at the Co-op! Rating: 4/5 † Nuts for Cheese Artichoke and Herb Cheese ($8.99)† The last flavor we tried from Nuts for Cheese was Artichoke and Herb,ù a semi-firm wedge with a nutty artichoke flavor and subtle hints of fresh herbs.† Y: This cheese had some lovely flavors; the hints of artichoke complimented the herbs nicely. It is a versatile cheese with a great balance of flavor and creaminess, and I could see it pairing well with fruits and bread. Rating: 3/5 H: In my opinion, this cheese outshined the others! I absolutely loved the mildness and subtlety of the artichoke balanced with the brightness of the lemon and basil. It's so creamy and versatile; it would work well on any sort of cracker or bread in any context, from an afternoon snack to a sophisticated charcuterie board. Rating: 5/5 We were both highly impressed by the Nuts for Cheese collection! You would never guess that their creamy, flavorful cheeses are plant-based and dairy-free. We recommend checking out their†website for more information, including a recipe page featuring upscale dishes using all of these cheeses!† Miyoko's Creamery Sundried Tomato Garlic Cheese ($8.99) The next cheese on the tasting itinerary is from Miyoko's Creamery, which Baymiller described as first on the scene for vegan cheese.ù Miyoko's boasts a large selection of creamy vegan cheeses, including their soft, spreadable cheese in the flavor Double Cream Sundried Tomato Garlic.ù Y: This cheese had a bit of a different texture than the others; it wasn't as creamy and didn't feel as spreadable as the ones previously mentioned. I enjoyed that I could get more hints of garlic than I could in the black garlic cheese, and the thin slices of sundried tomatoes were a nice addition to the flavor. Though the flavors were nice, I feel that creaminess is a really important factor for cheese, and this to me tasted more like a style of hummus rather than cheese. Rating: 2/5 H: The sweetness of the sundried tomatoes definitely takes center stage in this cream cheese-like spread. The notes of garlic contribute a savory, robust flavor. It reminded me of Italian food, like the nostalgic smell of sauteed garlic and simmering tomato sauce. I could see it working well in a pasta dish, melted in a grilled cheese or spread on a bagel. Rating: 3/5 Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus Violife Just Like Fetaù Cheese ($4.49) Violife, a highly praised and widely popular vegan cheese company, states that their Just Like Fetaù is a nod to their start in Thessaloniki, Greece. It's a potato starch-based cheese soaked in a salty brine. Y: This was personally my favorite cheese! It had such a smooth, buttery quality that wonderfully complimented a slice of apple. It wasn't as crumbly as feta, but the taste was remarkably similar and immensely refreshing when paired with fruit. I will definitely be purchasing it, as it not only has a fresh and creamy flavor, but it's also versatile for salads and fruits. It's also the most environmentally friendly because it doesn't rely on dairy or nuts. Rating: 5/5 H: Before even biting into this cheese, I could smell the familiar piquant odor associated with Greek feta. It was pleasantly sharp and bright with a delicious, creamy texture î incredibly accurate to dairy feta. It would be perfect for crumbling in a Greek salad or baked with phyllo pastry and agave nectar for an elevated appetizer. Rating: 4.5/5 Although neither of us is vegan, we thoroughly enjoyed indulging in the Co-op's vegan cheeses. They are just as creamy, decadent and delicious as dairy cheese, while having less of an impact on the environment or animals. We encourage you to try them for yourself î pay a visit to the vegan section at the I.V. Food Co-op where you can buy all of these cheeses and more!

on-the-menu,A Refreshing Springtime Pasta Salad,14-Apr-22,9:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-14/a-refreshing-springtime-pasta-salad/,"Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus With heatwave after heatwave rolling through Isla Vista, it's time to put warm winter dishes to the side. I mean, what's more uncomfortable than forcing down hot soup in 80-degree weather? Save yourself some sweat and try out this super easy, chilled pasta salad instead.† The best part about this recipe is its versatility. Pretty much every ingredient can be switched out without consequence. Don't have broccoli and bell pepper but have zucchini and asparagus? Sure, throw them in. Prefer another type of salad dressing? Any Italian or vinaigrette dressing will work just fine. Want to go vegetarian? Leave out the sausage and lose no flavor. Any combination is a good combination î trust me, I've tried them all. Ingredients (makes 4 servings):† Directions: If you often find yourself in a time crunch around mealtimes due to class, work or the surf, you can make this dish in advance and keep it in the fridge until you need to eat it. The salad dressing acts as a marinade, meaning it only gets better with time. I recommend taking advantage of the sun and bringing this pasta salad with you on your next beach picnic!

on-the-menu,Farmers Market Finds: Camino Real Marketplace,21-Apr-22,9:00 AM,"['Yuriko Chavez', 'Stephanie Gerson']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-21/farmers-market-finds-camino-real-marketplace/,"When you enter the Goleta farmers market, a wave of gratitude and joy will rush over you. Amidst the white tents and rows upon rows of colorful vegetables, you can't help but feel extremely lucky that this open-air market is a regular event in Goleta. Farmers' markets are extremely important for local farms and the overall community. Consumers are able to form a connection with the people who put in so much time and effort to grow and harvest food, something that you can't experience at your everyday, conventional grocery store. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus In addition to the community-building aspect, the environmental impacts of farmers' markets are worth noting. Many fruits and vegetables at the market are packaged without plastic or excessive packaging, almost all food is grown organically without harmful pesticides, and locally sourced produce travels about 27 times less distance than conventionally sourced produce. Overall, farmers' markets boast a much smaller carbon footprint than commercial markets.† The Goleta farmers market is hosted every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Camino Real Marketplace, just a few minutes away from UC Santa Barbara. Vendors travel from all over Santa Barbara County to sell fresh produce, flowers, baked goods, body products and more. On the Menu Staff Writer Yuriko Chavez and Assistant Editor Stephanie Gerson set out on a Sunday morning to do their regular food shopping and spoke with a few of the lovely vendors who sell at the market regularly. Ojai Microgreens Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus We were drawn to the Ojai Microgreens stand by their table of intriguing beds of wheatgrass and multicolored sprouts. Their microgreens are the perfect addition to brighten up salads, sandwiches and almost any dish. According to their website, Buddy Barnett, their founder, discovered the health benefits of microgreens while struggling with cancer and started growing microgreens himself. We spoke with Mariana, an operator of the stand and someone who has worked with the family's farm for years. She happily stated, We love to come and provide the community with some fresh sprouts and microgreens which are also super healthy for you.ù Ojai Microgreens have been an active vendor within farmers markets since 1996, and their products are exclusively available through those markets.† Ebby's Organic Farm Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The Ebby's Organic Farm stand had a colorful array of carrots, root vegetables and over a dozen varieties of lettuce. We interviewed Lorena Iniguez, who runs the farm with her husband, Mike Iniguez. They've been managing their organic farm for over 40 years, and their 11-acre farm is located in Goleta. Iniguez emphasized the struggles of running a farm, especially in the dry Santa Barbara area. Most people are unaware that smaller farms don't own their own land and they face a lot of challenges like water lendingù from the county. Despite these hardships, Ebby's Organic Farm has since been thriving at the farmers' markets for 15 years. Farmers' market vending meant that the Iniguez family could grow more varietyù and a smaller quantity of crops in order to adjust to the farmers' market crowd that is looking for a diverse selection of produce.† Shepherd Farms Spread out among the tables are a wide variety of vibrant produce, such as numerous types of leafy greens and bright red beets. Running the stand is a family of three, who collaborate smoothly together while numerous customers gather to their stand. We interviewed the daughter of the couple, Kimberly Iniguez, who has been working at farmers' markets for over 20 years. She shares that her dad began working for their partner in Shepard Farms for over 30 years and then about 10 years ago, her dad became a partner himself, so they've become increasingly more involved in the community. She smiles brightly as she raves about her mom's salsa which will be available in the summer: Make sure you come back in the summertime!ù Chavez Family Farms Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Even from a distance, you can smell the sweet scent of Chavez Family Farms' berries. They have an abundance of strawberries, blueberries, broccoli, spinach, cilantro and more. We spoke with Aldo Chavez, whose father began his business farming in Santa Maria, California in 1988. Though they have a large assortment of vegetables, Chavez said that their main thing is mostly strawberries, blueberries, raspberries [and] blackberries.ù Their family farm will also be generational, as Chavez shared, After I finished school, I decided to go and help them and get more involved in the business. So for the last five years, I've been a lot more invested in it.ù† Vendors that were not present at the market on Sunday, April 17 that we also love include Burkdoll Farms and Baba Small Batch Hummus. Burkdoll Farm mainly sells fruit varieties. They also make delicious homemade jam in flavors such as Peach Raspberry. Baba Small Batch Hummus sells a variety of dips and pita crackers with flavor combinations you may have never seen before. Their dill and mint hummus is quite phenomenal. Hopefully these two vendors return to Goleta next weekend.† The Goleta farmers market prides itself with unbeatable prices, high-quality produce and the most welcoming vendors. There truly is something for everyone whether you're into rare mushroom varieties, freshly baked bread, lush lettuce or juicy strawberries. While the Goleta market is held on Sundays, the Santa Barbara Certified Farmers' Market Association hosts five other markets in Santa Barbara County throughout the week. Grab your reusable bags and go support your local farms! A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the April 21, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

As a transfer and now graduating senior, I have made it my mission to eat at every restaurant in Isla Vista and complete this bucket list.ù So far I have been pretty consistent with my quest.† Founded and owned by our very own UC Santa Barbara student Jaime Hernandez, who is graduating this year majoring in chemistry, Z√≥calo is 100% family-owned; the entire family has had an impact on everything from the website and logo to the cooks in the back!† Maiyan Pearl / Daily Nexus Everything on the menu is homemade. According to Hernandez, you will rarely find canned goods in their kitchen. This is especially true for their horchata, which has been given a fun, caffeinated twist with the addition of two shots of coffee.† Even the horchata is 100% homemade; we use rice milk and cinnamon sticks,ù Hernandez said. You get the nice flavor of coffee but mixed with the cinnamon and the rice milk and it has a really good taste to it!ù If you are looking for a new coffee shop to try, you definitely need to check out their drink menu.† Their menu consists of classic Mexican cuisine such as tacos and burritos, but the most popular item is their torta. A torta is a type of Mexican sandwich usually consisting of beans, mayonnaise, lettuce, pico de gallo and your choice of protein, served with fresh baked Mexican telera bread. They also have a plethora of breakfast options like huevos rancheros and different bagel sandwiches.† When asked about the inspiration behind Z√≥calo, Hernandez explained that the restaurant is named after the main square in Mexico City. It's where they do independence days celebrations and it's a big center for everything,ù Hernandez said. Just like the main square, Z√≥calo hopes to be a central meeting place for Isla Vista students. This is the place for team meetings, catching up with friends, grabbing a coffee and some delicious food îit's a one-stop shop!† If I could describe Z√≥calo in three words it would be authentic, loving and homemade!

on-the-menu,A Night at Captain Fatty's,21-Apr-22,12:01 PM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-21/a-night-at-captain-fattys/,"Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Located on ãã6489 Calle Real, Suite D, Goleta, CA 93117, Captain Fatty's Brewery is a cozy bar tucked off Los Carneros Road by the roundabout to Trader Joe's. Without a local, I would have needed really good luck to find this hidden gem.†† My friends and I went around 6 p.m. and there was a lot of parking in both the front and back. The place itself had a lively ambiance. Everyone seemed to be lightly chatting and drinking to de-stress after a long day. Some men and their dog were playing a hook game.† The brewery had a variety of unique seating options like couches, picnic tables and a bar. We sat at a log table in the front.† For my first drink, I selected a Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout. It sounded charming. I've had a spiked chocolate milkshake before, so I was curious. The drink had a gorgeous dark chocolate color. The bartender offered cayenne pepper and cinnamon as toppings. I appreciated the cinnamon. After a few sips, the sticky thickness of this drink was not for me.† My Puerto Rican friend went inside with the beer and traded it for the Vortex IPA which has Cascade and Mosaic hops. According to her, usually in bars, if the drink is not good you can exchange it. The Vortex IPA was sweeter and more enjoyable for slow sips.† In the back, the Santa Barbara Woodfire Catering sells pizza. After getting beers from Captain Fatty's, we paid them a visit. Three fluffy dogs growled and wrestled by the cashier's feet. The pizzas are 12-inches and $12, with a dollar extra for each topping. The cashier recommended their Goat Pizza which has goat cheese, ham, arugula and the most fascinating pizza sauce: habanero apricot jam.† I was slowly sipping my beer, because I wanted to pair it with the pizza. The pizza took quite a long time to come out. I was quite impatient, but it was worth it.† The Goat Pizza was quite a magical experience. The habanero apricot jam added a pleasant sweetness and the most gentle slap of heat. The goat cheese was crumbly and addictive. The ham was roasted and slightly crispy. The arugula was topped after roasting, so it was super fresh and raw: a beautiful harmony.† When my out-of-town friends come to visit next, I will bring them to this amazing microbrewery and pizzeria, perfect place to catch up, drink and dine.

on-the-menu,Fonio: The West African Grain of the Future,28-Apr-22,11:10 AM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-28/fonio-the-west-african-grain-of-the-future/,"Chace Duma / Daily Nexus The other day, I was at the Isla Vista Food Cooperative doing some grocery shopping. I came across a bag of fonio, a grain I'd never heard of. Always eager to try something new, I grabbed the bag and checked out. After doing some research into fonio and the company, Yol√©l√©, that sells it, I'm happy to say I've found a new pantry staple; the history of this grain and Yol√©l√©'s mission are both fascinating and wonderful. According to Yol√©l√©'s website, fonio has grown in the West African Sahel region for over five thousand years. The Dogon people of Mali, an indigenous population who've grown fonio for millenia, refer to fonio as The Seed of the Universe.ù Not only does that speak to the cultural importance of fonio, but I believe that's the single coolest descriptor I've ever seen attached to a food. Nutritionally speaking, it's rich in iron, fiber, vitamin B, zinc, magnesium and antioxidants. Furthermore, it contains methionine and cysteine î two amino acids practically absent in all other grains î which promote hair, skin and nail growth. Plus, it's gluten free! Due to its nutritional content and digestibility, it's a favorite among pregnant and nursing women and is often given to infants who are just beginning to eat solid food.† Yol√©l√©, as a company, is dedicated to supporting West African farming communities, many of which are extremely impoverished. Yol√©l√© works with smallholder farms,ù a term new to me in researching the company. Smallholder farmsù refers to any small farm (under 5 acres) that is usually managed by a single family. Many of the smallholder farmers in West Africa don't have access to markets, instead selling produce on the side of the road. Without a market presence, it's extremely difficult for these individuals and their communities to make a stable living; there simply aren't enough customers. Yol√©l√© works with these smallholder farms, especially female-managed farms, to connect them with the global market (hence me finding fonio at the I.V. Food Co-op!) so they can reach more customers.† Another advantage Yol√©l√© finds in supporting West African smallholder farms is their sustainable agricultural practices. According to the aboutù section of Yol√©l√©'s website, smallholder farms employ regenerative techniques like intercropping, cover-cropping, and crop rotation,ù all techniques that defend the Sahel against climate change. Funding for agricultural development in West Africa mainly goes toward large, corporation-owned monocropped farms that, through their intensive use of chemicals and refusal to rotate crops, slowly degrade the soil and ruin the land on which they're growing. By supporting sustainable smallholder farms, Yol√©l√© puts money behind farming practices that have the potential to reverse harmful consequences of climate change and gives these farms the economic backbone they need to continue practicing regenerative agriculture.† Fonio itself is an extremely climate-change-resistant crop. The Sahel isn't exactly the most habitable growing zone: It's dry, it's sandy and it's extremely hot. Fonio, however, flourishes in the Sahel. Fonio is reliable, growing even in seasons when other crops fail. Not only that, it's quick to grow. Fonio is usually the first crop to be harvested in the hungry season,ù before other crops are ready to be harvested. Over the next few decades, due to the uncaged, ravenous and governmentally ignored monster that is climate change, many of our growing zones are going to become more and more like the Sahel. Crops like fonio that produce quickly, reliably and in harsh conditions will be instrumental to our continued survival.† Chace Duma / Daily Nexus So¶ how does it taste?† In one word: Great! First of all, the cooking process couldn't be easier. Bring 2 parts water to a boil, add 1 part fonio, stir it and add some salt, let it return to a boil, then cover it with a lid, take it off the heat, and let it sit for 5 minutes. Boom! Perfect fonio. It expands like crazy, too; a half cup of dried fonio was enough to feed both me and my girlfriend. It has a lovely texture, crumbly but moist enough that it clumps together into satisfying bites. I'd compare the taste to amaranth, a slightly more popular ancient grain commonly used by Native Americans. Though, fonio's grains are smaller, and it doesn't taste as earthy. It's great on its own, but I think it shines as a foundation upon which to build further. My girlfriend and I fried it up with some squash, carrots and tomato paste, and put some chicken thighs on top, all seasoned with berbere (an Ethiopian spice blend), which was delicious!† So please, go out and try some fonio! Yol√©l√© has a wonderful mission and sells delicious products; I can hardly think of a better company to support at the moment. If you're not into the idea of cooking the grain itself, Yol√©l√© sells many other fonio-related products including fonio flour and many flavors of fonio pilaf and fonio chips. Head to the I.V. Food Co-Op to buy locally, or purchase on Yol√©l√©'s website!† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the April 28, 2022 edition of the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,Vegan Jackfruit Taquitos,28-Apr-22,11:13 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-28/vegan-jackfruit-taquitos/,"Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus One of my favorite vegan-friendly items in Isla Vista has to be the potato taquitos from Super Cucas. Located near the cash register is their not-so-secret vegan menu with seven options for plant-based eaters including the taquitos, soy chorizo burritos and more. The crispy taquitos are filled with potatoes and served on a bed of lettuce with guacamole and pico de gallo. I've stumbled into Super Cucas on many occasions, and these taquitos always hit the spot. I've always wanted to put my own spin on the Super Cucas taquitos and play around with different fillings. Lately I've been intrigued with jackfruit as a meat substitute. Jackfruit is known for its stringy texture that mimics pulled pork. Jackfruit has a very mild flavor on its own but, when seasoned correctly, can easily be mistaken for shredded meat. These jackfruit taquitos make the perfect appetizer and will definitely be a crowd pleaser. Ingredients (makes 8 taquitos): Directions: I love that this recipe relies on a single fruit as the star ingredient rather than a plant-based meat substitute with unpronounceable ingredients. The jackfruit mixture featured in the recipe is also quite versatile and can be used for tacos and even sandwiches. With summer approaching, these taquitos will definitely be your go-to item to bring to a barbecue. A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the April 28, 2022 edition of the Daily Nexus

on-the-menu,"Carrillo, My Beloved: A Review of Dining Hall Food",5-May-22,9:00 AM,['Faith Talamantez'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-05/carrillo-my-beloved-a-review-of-dining-hall-food/,"Faith Talamantez / Daily Nexus Carrillo: a dining hall, a home, a place where you feel extremely judged and, most of all, my favorite dining hall on campus. A controversial take, and surely not everyone will agree. However, Carrillo and I are ride or die, and I would put my life on the line in defense of it. In all seriousness, I regularly enjoy the food and the vibes in Carrillo and hope that this article isn't so good as to flood Carrillo with all the people dying to try my recommendations.† I eat pretty regularly in Carrillo, and their menu tends to cycle through similar dishes every week. Every once in a while, we get a real treat like sweet potato fries or the highly sought-after chicken parmesan. But usually, we stick to the same cycle. I'm not complaining (most of the time) î Carrillo has a pretty banger lineup. What better to kick off my review of Carrillo's yummy little menu besides their barbecue chicken pizza. I am biased, but it doesn't even matter because this pizza is so good. On days when they have barbecue chicken pizza, you can catch my butt glued to a seat in Carrillo for lunch and dinner, absolutely demolishing as many slices as they let me. The barbecue sauce is on the sweeter side, which I think works well in combination with the rest of the toppings. I feel it is important to mention now that I am not the greatest cook myself and have a very limited knowledge of food and also that I hate vegetables. Anyways, whatever the green stuff they put on the pizza is (Cilantro? Green onion? Leaves from the floor outside?), it is just an absolute perfect addition to the flavor. Sometimes, when I am lucky enough to be grabbing a slice right after it comes out of the oven, I get to watch the chefs put the green stuff on the pizza. Total slay. Please go get a slice next time you find yourself at Carrillo, unless you see me also waiting for a slice, in which case let me get one first. Be sure to eat the crust, or everyone will think you are a baby.† The Mongolian grill and I have a love-hate relationship. I do like a lot of the things they serve, but when the food misses, it misses by 1,000 miles. First, fortunately a total hit, is the teriyaki chicken stir-fry with brown rice. Anytime you see something that says stir-fryù at Carrillo, know that you are getting 75% vegetables unless you get a lucky scoop that has more meat. I am one lucky little girl. My bowl had a good amount of meat in it, and I was happy to indulge my inner cavewoman and go ham. The rice was cooked perfectly and was very delicious. The only complaint I have about these bowls is that sometimes the mushrooms look kind of like chicken, and I almost eat them. I don't know what I would do if I ate a mushroom. Probably die.† Next, also from the Mongolian grill but much worse, is the stir-fry noodles with vegetables. Unfortunately, this was so awful. It was literally just a bowl of noodles with one red pepper in it, so it barely qualifies as a stir-fry at all. This usually wouldn't be a complaint for me because I hate vegetables, but my god, the noodles were awful. They were undercooked and borderline crunchy. To make things worse, this bowl was absolutely DROWNED in sauce. Sometimes when Carrillo has a bad menu (not often), I think about how easily they can get away with it since they are the closest dining hall to DP and therefore serve the highest number of drunk students. Anyway, stay away from this stir-fryù if you can afford to. Keeping things consistent with the Mongolian dishes, next on my list is the pork stir-fry. Notice how often I am eating stir-fry. This is a call for help. Anyway, it was bussin. The sauce and the rice were both delicious. The pork was also good, for all of the two tiny bites of it that I got. This also happened to be my first meal of the day when I had it, and it was, like, 6 p.m. so it was especially yum. Honorable mentions from the Mongolian grill that you can literally never go wrong with are General Tso's chicken and beef chow mein. When either of those are on the menu, you can quite literally catch me at Carrillo's door 30 minutes before they open to be the first to get my grubby little hands on one of those bowls.† Moving away from the Mongolian grill and into some delicious pasta, I do have to admit my love for Carrillo pesto pasta and fettuccine alfredo. Both of these pastas will need salt, I assure you, but what doesn't need salt in a dining hall? Like, seriously, who stole the seasoning? It wouldn't hurt to add some. Anyway, both of these pastas are so delicious and yummy so long as you add salt. Don't forget to add salt or your food will taste bad. I'm serious.† Just down the road from the pasta, you can find chips and salsa. The salsa, of course, is served in a big fat bowl and looks really scary and suspicious, and the chips are usually super broken up because SOME PEOPLE don't know how to scoop chips. However, I love the chips and salsa and eat them pretty much every time they have them out. Not many good salsas can be found around here, but Carrillo's is usually pretty good. It should not surprise you that I will recommend that you add salt to the chips. Now, we are entering Faith's Carrillo Hall of Fame. Get down on your knees and bow down to our first award winner: the tortilla soup. Oh my god, you guys. I'm not normally a soup person until it comes to any soup that reminds me of home. As a Mexican student, it can definitely be difficult to believe that this is a Hispanic-Serving Institution when you see what the dining hall calls an enchilada,ù but this tortilla soup will make up for any and every complaint you have ever had about the other sorry excuses for Mexican food. It is so good that it tricks me into eating vegetables. It's flavorful, warm and makes me feel loved. I would kiss whoever made this soup. I'm serious. The only thing that could make this soup better is sharing it with people you love.† Next, and I know this may surprise many of you, is the horchata. I know î you're scared, you're confused and, most of all, you don't believe me. But have I lied to you ever? No. Listen to me. It's good. The horchata is good. It's not like the homemade stuff you would get at your favorite taqueria, but it is good. It's definitely just powder mix, but if you add ice and a little bit of extra cinnamon, it is delicious. It goes really well with the tortilla soup. Trust me, try it and add cinnamon to your liking. If you don't like it, you can club me or something, I swear it's pretty good.† Overall, what can I say except that I love Carrillo. It is as much a home to me as my own dorm room, except with way more people who all look like they hate me. The vibes in there are like no other î absolutely chill and happy and perfect. If you aren't lucky enough to live nearby, make the walk every once in a while to come and enjoy some of what Carrillo has to offer, and trust me, you will not be disappointed. Carrillo, with all my heart, I love you, and you will forever be my favorite dining hall.† A version of this article was published on p. 10 of the May 5, 2022 version of the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,Plant-Based/Keto Ice Cream: A History and Review,5-May-22,9:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-05/plant-based-keto-ice-cream-a-history-and-review/,"Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus If you're a big fan of the freezer aisle like me, you've probably noticed that plant-based and healthierù ice creams are taking over the frozen dessert market. For better or for worse, these newer versions of the original dairy product seem to be here to stay. Though the popularity behind plant-based ice cream has skyrocketed in recent years, there's a long history backing it up. In fact, the first record appears in an 1899 nut-based cookbook by Almeda Lambert, and consisted of nut cream, sugar and vanilla. Though the concept stayed the same, later confectionists continued experimenting with different dairy substitutes î particularly soy. In 1922, Lee Len Thuey of Indiana was issued the first patent for a tofu-based soy ice cream. The first commercial soy ice cream, produced by the Scientific Food & Benevolent Association and Henry Ford's research team, hit the market in the 1930s. In the 1950s, vegan ice cream hit a hurdle when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled that Chill-Zert soy ice cream should instead be labeled as imitation ice cream.ù However, Robert Rich, the founder of Rich Products Corporation, fought the ruling and eventually won, which prevented nondairy ice cream from being marginalized from the greater ice cream market. In light of this victory, the late 20th century saw a handful of new dairy-free ice cream companies, including the still prominent brands Tofutti and Rice Dream. By the turn of the century, the popularity of dairy-free ice cream began to soar, and it continues to grow each year. The global dairy-free ice cream market size was valued at $595.26 million in 2021, and Forbes predicts it will surpass $1 billion by the year 2025.† A few factors spurring the rising interest in vegan ice creams, among plant-based foods in general, are consumers' lactose-intolerance and health concerns over dairy, and the shift toward sustainable substitutes for animal products and better-for-youù trends. Helping the market grow are established dairy brands launching their own vegan ice cream options, including H√§agen-Dazs, Breyers, Ben & Jerry's, Baskin-Robbins and Magnum.† Alongside plant-based ice creams, healthierù keto-friendly ice creams have witnessed a major rise. Brands, such as Open Nature Scandal-Less, Keto Foods and Rebel Creamery, advertise high protein content and shockingly low calorie counts due to the substitutions of skim milk and sugar alternatives. While the low-sugar ice cream industry lags behind the decades-established vegan ice cream industry, it shows great potential for growth in forthcoming years. Plant-based and keto-friendly ice cream options hold the upper hand in health and environmental impact, but the factor of taste should not go overlooked. I went to my local grocery stores and picked out four options to determine whether they can compare to traditional dairy ice cream. † Trader Joe's Strawberry Non-Dairy Oat Frozen Dessert† This oat-based version was uber creamy and imitated ice cream well, but the strawberry flavor was barely there. Combined with the oat undertones, it weirdly reminded me of a liquid version of strawberry mochi î interpret that as you will. I probably wouldn't buy it again. Rating: 3/5 † Coconut Bliss Frozen Dessert Sea Salt Caramel Chocolate† This one was made out of a coconut milk base, and a coconut flavor permeates the whole thing. Surprisingly, the combination of coconut and sea salt caramel wasn't too off-putting. This was the densest one I tried, but it still managed to be creamy. The best part in my opinion, though, was that it had vegan chocolate bits mixed in. Honestly, my biggest grievance was how salty it was. Usually, I'm a huge salt enthusiast, but this was way too much. Rating: 4/5 † Open Nature Scandal-Less Cookies & Cream Light Ice Cream† This was the only non-vegan and keto-friendly option I tried. The first thing I noticed was how light it was. Due to the skim-milk base, it's way more aerated than regular ice cream and is borderline icey instead of creamy. However, since it is made of milk, it lacked any odd oat or coconut aftertaste. I can definitely understand the popularity behind this one. Rating: 4/5 † Dream Pops Vanilla Sky Bites These coconut-milk based ice cream bites were covered in chocolate, so they resembled a vegan version of Dibs rather than regular ice cream. I thought the taste was spot-on accurate to vanilla ice cream, if only a little more icey than creamy. It may help that the vegan chocolate covering helped disguise the lack of dairy, but either way I loved it. Rating: 5/5 Notably, all these choices all cost around $4, which is pretty cheap in comparison to $6 pint of Ben & Jerry's. For that reason alone, I might consider making the permanent switch! No matter what is fueling your interest in vegan- and keto-friendly ice creams, I encourage you to give them a try î with dozens of brands and flavors on the market, you're bound to find one you love.

The idea of the restaurant started when the previous tenants approached Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr. when they were closing down their business and offered the space. At first, Hern√°ndez Sr. was unsure about opening the restaurant, but after a year, he accepted. The family felt like it was a sign that Jaime Hern√°ndez Jr., their son, had finished his last UC Santa Barbara final the same day and time that the previous tenants were moving out. They felt like this was a sign that they should open Z√≥calo due to the timing of the two events. We thought, If God wants, in March if Jaime Jr. finishes [his] school career then it will be real. If not, then really we don't want to. And everything happened exactly like that,ù Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr. said.  Mexico City is home to the plaza Z√≥calo, where people celebrate, and everyone feels the annual celebratory yell on Mexico's Independence Day. Now, Isla Vista has their own Z√≥calo.† Z√≥calo opened to integrate authentic Mexican food into Isla Vista. Jaime Hern√°ndez Jr., a recent UCSB first-generation chemistry graduate, spearheaded the administrative part of the business. While he never saw this as a part of his future, now that he is here, he sees this as a backup plan.† The plan of this restaurant is to have a retirement plan for my parents. They took care of me when I was little and this is my way of taking care of them. If it works, I can go and have a career in Chemistry,ù Jaime Hern√°ndez Jr. said. The family immigrated to the United States and settled down in Carpinteria after their son Jaime was born. Olivia Hern√°ndez, the mother of the family, grew up in a small town part of the Mexican States and has worked in restaurants as a prep cook. Meanwhile, Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr. grew up in Mexico City and also worked in many restaurants. These restaurant industry jobs gave them the experience to co-manage Z√≥calo.† Since my childhood, I worked as a dishwasher. I started standing on a box since I was so small. This was in Mexico and there I worked my way up in the kitchen. I was a cook and bartender, and here in the US, I worked in a lot of restaurants,ù Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr. said.† Olivia Hern√°ndez has also worked in the restaurant industry as a prep cook.† While Jaime Hern√°ndez Jr. covered the administrative work while completing his studies, the entire family was also involved in the restaurant.† Everyone is a part of the restaurant. My son is the one that does the technical things like how the menu functions, and he also is in charge of everything administrative. But, he also helps out in the kitchen,ù said Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr.† Their daughter, Hannia Hern√°ndez, a UC Los Angeles student, is in charge of their social media presence. While she cannot be present to help with the day-to-day tasks, she has found a way to help the business despite the distance.† The youngest son, Edwin Hern√°ndez, designed the website and is in the process of designing merchandise.† Some people take months to learn the cashier system of a restaurant but he learned it in an hour,ù Jaime Hern√°ndez Jr. said. As they neared finally opening their doors, they realized they wanted to make Z√≥calo unique.† Walk into a restaurant in Isla Vista and no one says òHi' to you anymore. We want this to feel like a home,ù said Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr. Besides the restaurant's atmosphere, they wanted to make their menu unique as well.† Breakfast was also one of those things that we thought sometimes college students can't enjoy breakfast because the morning passed by them. There is a lot of desire for bagels in the afternoon with bacon or chipotle cream cheese. We can see in the evening that our bagels are almost sold out,ù Jaime Hern√°ndez Jr. said.† Along with bagels, and the more traditional Mexican entrees like tacos, burritos and enchiladas, Z√≥calo offers a menu that includes a variety of drinks ranging from traditional aguas frescasù (juices) to their house-made horchata. Additionally, they are constantly thinking of new things to add to the menu and ways to experiment with different foods.† The horchata is made in the restaurant. There is also an option to add coffee to the drink. Ewa Zakrzewska / Daily Nexus With this menu, Z√≥calo prioritizes and prides itself on using the best and freshest ingredients. Olivia Hern√°ndez laughs as she tells us that while she won't give us her recipe, she emphasizes that everything is natural.† Everything is natural. Including the seasonings, when you walk into the kitchen, the only thing you will find is garlic salt, but all the ingredients are natural,ù Olivia Hern√°ndez said. Jaime Hern√°ndez Sr. agreed with that statement.  We do not grab any kind of meat from the store. We try to buy the best meat ad we know that while it may be a little more expensive, we want to give our clients the best so they can feel the freshness in the food.ù Once they opened their doors to the Isla Vista community, they realized how much of an impact this had on their lives.† Yes, it does change your life because when we started, I felt like this was too much after my job. But, one day, I arrived, and I felt like the food carried an extra ingredient, love.ù Besides their unique menu, they also wanted to offer this space to the community.† Once, a girl told me, òI came here yesterday and am embarrassed to come again.' And I told her not to be embarrassed. I had some guava so I offered her some and she was like òreally?' and when I said yes she told me that she felt so much love and I was left feeling like wow,ù Olivia Hern√°ndez said.†  Z√≥calo in Mexico City reminds the family of their home. Now, they want Z√≥calo to be a taste of home for college students.† Z√≥calo is a place where everyone comes together. Where people can share and come to a place that feels like home. You can come and taste the seasoning that you miss from home.ù

When I came back to Santa Barbara after it was announced that in-person instruction would be resuming, I really craved a more diverse selection of Asian cuisine, especially Korean food. But, the only Korean restaurant I could find was Kimchi Korean BBQ. I craved a greater variety of Korean food and, for months, I was frustrated that I couldn't find a more expansive Korean restaurant. That is until one of my roommates mentioned Choi's Oriental Market. While Choi's Oriental Market is primarily an Asian grocery store, this hidden gem of Santa Barbara is also a Korean restaurant, serving traditional Korean food like kimchi-jjigae and bibimbap. My friends and I started our trip by buying drinks in the grocery store. I got an Evergreen Coconut Milk Drink while my two roommates got Ramune and Jarritos. We then ordered our food at the front desk. I ordered jajangmyeon, a Korean noodle dish topped with diced pork, onions, a slice of cucumber and black bean sauce. My roommates ordered kimchi-jjigae, a kimchi-based stew and naengmyeon, a cold noodle dish. The food at Choi's Oriental Market is what makes this place truly special. This was my first time trying jajangmyeon and it was delicious î easily one of my favorite noodle dishes ever! The noodles were perfectly chewy and the sauce provided a very delicious complement to the noodles. The diced pork and onions added an extra layer of flavor, crispness and crunchiness. In Korean cuisine, an array of side dishes called banchan is included with each dish you order. Generally, most dishes come with a side of kimchi. For my noodle dish, I got a side of pickled radishes called danmuji while my friends got a side of spicy cucumbers and kimchi. The side dishes were a refreshing palate cleanser and provided a delicious crunchiness to our dishes. Naengmyeon was a combination of perfectly chewy noodles and cold broth, making it a great dish to have on a hot day. The kimchi-jjigae was delicious î the broth had a nice balance of savouriness and smoothness, and the tofu added great texture. The Evergreen Coconut Milk Drink was delicious all on its own. The coconut milk was smooth, creamy and full of coconut goodness and flavor while having some chewy coconut pieces inside the milk that provided a nice, textural contrast. I also felt like it provided a nice complement to my jajangmyeon noodle dish. Before ordering food, I highly recommend and encourage ordering a drink to go with your meal. However, the food is not the only unique feature of Choi's Oriental Market. As you can guess from the name, the place is a market itself where you can buy Asian and Korean ingredients that you can't find in a typical grocery store. That in itself got me so excited to try out Choi's Oriental Market. They had all of my favorite Korean items: soju, buldak noodles, kimchi, etc. I got so excited that I even ended up buying over $100 worth of Korean and Asian ingredients! Choi's Oriental Market is certainly the place to grab Korean food, so don't miss out! A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the May 12, 2022 version of the Daily Nexus

Although it endured many changes and challenges in its early years, it remained strong and continued to serve the community with its democratic process and customer-minded focus. Today's Isla Vista Food Co-op has long served as an affordable, healthy, and environmentally minded establishment, bringing Isla Vista residents together through good food. Kimberly Kiefer, general manager of the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District, organized the Isla Vista Spring Concert Series which provided the musical entertainment for the event. She says she was honored to work in coordination with the Co-op and celebrate their 50th anniversary.ù Performers included local artists Odd Army, imKENNETHY, jomch and more. Along with watching musical performances, event goers also had the opportunity to watch the live creation of a spray-painted mural or receive free face painting and henna tattoos. Kiefer highlighted the importance of active participation in the parks and opportunities for artists to showcase their work to the community. Representatives from organizations including CalFresh, the Edible Campus Program, the Isla Vista Community Services District, the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, and the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District tabled at the event, offering resources for students about food insecurity, community gardens, local government, and more.† The I.V. Food Co-op provided plenty of refreshments, such as vegan wraps, cookies from Santa Barbara Cookie Company, vegan and gluten-free cupcakes from Crushcakes & Caf√© and, of course, fresh seasonal fruit. Santa Barbara Cookie Company is Santa Barbara owned and operatedù (cookiesofsb.com) and their cookies are sold at the Co-op.

on-the-menu,Senior Sendoff- an Ode to My Favorite Restaurants,19-May-22,9:34 AM,['Jill Ridens'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-19/senior-sendoff-an-ode-to-my-favorite-restaurants/,"Wow, the time has finally come. In just a few short weeks, I'll walk across the graduation stage and say goodbye to this lovely town I've called home. I am so grateful for my time at UC Santa Barbara and how it has really become my place. During my time in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista, the food and restaurants have really made me sad to leave. So here we have it, in no particular order, an ode to my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara. Cheers.† An Isla Vista Favorite, Caj√© Thank you ããCaj√© for fueling my caffeine addiction the past two years. Caj√© is the spot for everyone to gather after a night out, eating bagels and acai bowls, while we people watch at the front tables. Thank you to the baristas who knew my name when I came in and for making me my The Worksù bagel. Also, my $7 oat milk latte will truly be missed.† Pali Wine Co. Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus As soon as all my friends and I turned 21, all we wanted to do was go wine tasting. Pali Wine Co. in the Funk Zone was our spot for many Saturday afternoon tasting flights. Pali always brought great vibes and great people, and you could always count on a dog to be there. The live music was always just a great way to add to the already immaculate vibes. When I think about wine country and Santa Barbara, I'll always think of Pali.† Flor De Maiz Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus I am constantly craving Flor De Maiz; it's seriously the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Not only is the food amazing, but the ocean view pushes it into must-visit territory. The tortillas and rice are always so fresh and the margaritas have the perfect amount of spice. This place got me hooked on seafood, and because of that, all I ever ordered was the Tostada de Mariscos. (Seriously, this is a must-try). Thank you Flor de Maiz for all the fun dinners with my friends and always being the place we would take our parents when they came to town.† Rockfire Grill Jill Ridens / Daily Nexus You can always count on me to be at Rockfire in Isla Vista every week for Wing Wednesday. This place is a classic IV hangout; it's always a great spot to go to before a night out and a staple go-to meal. I watched countless sporting events and spent karaoke nights here and will always have memories of the luau music and house-made aioli. Thank you Rockfire for the memories, I will miss my Wing Wednesday nights. Santa Barbara and Isla Vista have treated me so well the past few years. Some of my fondest memories come from all the restaurants my friends and I went to, celebrating holidays, birthdays or just as an excuse for a night out.†

on-the-menu,Toma Restaurant and Bar: A Delightful Oceanfront Eatery,19-May-22,11:04 AM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-19/toma-restaurant-and-bar-a-delightful-oceanfront-eatery/,"Located on 324 W. Cabrillo Blvd., Toma, a gorgeous restaurant with an Italian-inspired Mediterranean menu, sits on the oceanfront near the Santa Barbara pier.† The warm candles, low ceiling and white covers draping over the tables created a romantic ambiance. Everyone was dressed to the nines. My kindred spirit and I came with reservations î outdoors because the indoor reservations were fully booked. I did not know how to feel about the plastic covering stretching like malleable windows around the outdoor seating. The wind battered the plastic as uncomfortable background noise.† We came at night, so the ocean view was a cozy pitch black stretching through the horizon. Toma offers a full bar with a long wine and cocktail menu, but as it was a Monday school night, we decided to stick with water. First came some complimentary fried olives and bread and butter. I personally am not a strong fan of olives, but these were exciting, as they burst and melted in the mouth. The bread was a soft baguette, and we used a unique-shaped butter knife to smear the fat slab of room temperature salted butter. They offered more complimentary bread and butter if we wanted, but we wanted to save space for the dishes we wanted to try. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Then, the server brought the grilled Spanish octopus. Long octopus legs î perfectly succulent and not rubbery î were intertwined with a cornucopia of toppings: romanesco, fregola pasta, olives, gremolata, tobiko roe and large dollops of smoked tomato remoulade. I had never worked with any of these ingredients before, so I was pleasantly surprised. It was such a busy sight: colorful with explosively fun textures.† Our entrees of duck confit flatbread and ravioli plus a side of mushroom risotto came together. Two servers had to balance and move the table decor around to fit on our two-person table, which we were lightly humored about, as we often enjoy ordering more for leftovers. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus The duck confit flatbread was served on a wooden paddle, wealthy with toppings. The balsamic-glazed onions and honey-roasted pears made the dish powerful with sweetness. I loved how bright the arugula pesto tasted and how crumbly the herbed ricotta was. The duck confit tasted a little dry and near crispy. Overall, I thought this dish had an exciting combination of ingredients that worked really well together.† The ravioli dish consisted of five pieces, plump with ricotta and kale. I loved the aromatic basil and the halves of cherry tomatoes that dissolved in a bite. The mushroom risotto was thick and homogeneous, except for the sprigs as garnish. We found the dish extremely creamy to the point where the rice unfortunately lost its shape. It was more of a porridge than anything.† And of course, we couldn't leave without tasting their desserts, which all sounded extraordinary. We ordered the citrus olive oil cake and vanilla panna cotta. The citrus olive oil cake was saturated; so moist that it became overwhelming toward the last few bites of the cake. The chunky, chopped almonds offered a nutty texture to the cake. The peeled grapefruit and orange segments looked like synchronized swimmers in the zesty sauce. The scoop of vanilla bean ice cream was my favorite part: refreshing and creamy. It was almost like an orange creamsicle.†† The vanilla panna cotta was so smooth with a gentle bounce, it almost reminded me of chocolate mousse. The strawberry basil broth in which the panna cotta sat reminded me of strawberry lemonade.† We spent almost three hours here enjoying the food and catching up. Between meals, they swapped our plates and utensils. Perhaps, next time we return, we ought to brush up on our table etiquette and learn both the names and order of the different tools to maximize our enjoyment of this intimate food experience.† SheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeSh

on-the-menu,Healthy Baking Substitutes,19-May-22,11:31 AM,['Maya Salem'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-19/healthy-baking-substitutes/,"When I was in preschool and made my first batch of muffins for class, my mother told me to substitute applesauce for oil. A curious suggestion, I thought. For brownies, cakes and banana bread, we've always used applesauce in lieu of oil. For a while I wondered why the ingredient lists even included oil. It was clearly an unwritten, unspoken rule.† It wasn't until recently I learned this is not a standardized practice. But, it totally should be. Eliminating some of the saturated fat and added sugar, this particular substitute is a pretty fool-proof choice. Unless, of course, you have an allergy to apples.† I have compiled some of my favorite substitutes for dietary restrictions, healthy cooking or times when you've simply run out of eggs.† Buttermilk Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Buttermilk is really just fermented milk. Its acidic quality aids in the leavening process of baking. It also breaks down proteins, such as gluten, resulting in a more delicate crumb.† In order to achieve that same characteristic with a substitute, simply add an acid. For example, for a cup of buttermilk, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to a measuring cup and fill the rest with milk. It's important to let the mixture sit for a few minutes before incorporating it into your recipe. Milk For 1 cup of milk, substitute 1 cup of buttermilk plus Ω teaspoon baking soda. Or, 1 cup of skim milk plus 2 teaspoons of oil/fat. In baking, depending on the recipe, a 1-to-1 ratio of fruit juice can be sometimes substituted for milk. Make sure to adjust any additional sugar levels. Chocolate or Cocoa Powder Substitute 3 tablespoons of cocoa plus 1 tablespoon of shortening for 1 square (or tablespoon) of unsweetened chocolate, or vice versa.† This one is pretty self-explanatory. If you've used up your cocoa powder on homemade hot chocolate mixes or forgot that you snacked on the rest of the chocolate chips while watching Bridgertonù last night, this substitute has you covered! Applesauce for Oil Unsweetened applesauce can be used pretty universally in a 1-to-1 ratio for baking. The antioxidant-rich fruit contains no fat, unlike its 109-grams counterpart. It also keeps your baked goods moist.† If you have no applesauce on hand, a mashed banana or other pureed fruit can work in a pinch. Cornstarch For most cooking purposes, you can substitute 2 teaspoons of flour for 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Cornstarch is a pretty unique, though somewhat uncommonly used, ingredient. It's usually just used as a thickening agent.† If you're looking for a vegan egg substitute, you can also mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of warm water. This is best used in cookies, cakes or breads. Herbs, Spices, Seasonings† The general rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon fresh equals Öì to Ω teaspoon dried. When you don't have access to the fresh stuff, dried seasonings work pretty much the same. It's important to remember that dried herbs are more concentrated, so stick to this ratio.†† Black Beans for Flour Maya Salem / Daily Nexus Rinsed and drained black beans can be pureed and substituted for flour in baking. Not only does it provide a gluten-free option, but it also provides a good source of protein! One can of black beans has double the amount of protein than flour. Bananas for Sugar Similar to the applesauce tip, bananas can be substituted for sugar. As fruits ripen, their nutrient makeup changes, an evolutionary tactic to encourage animals to eat them and spread their seeds. This breakdown in starch is fairly easy to see in bananas, as they become more colorful. In other words, the more spotted the fruit, the sweeter. Simply add one mashed ripe or overripe banana (plus a little water to balance the viscosity) to your baked good, in place of 1 cup of sugar. Figs and dates work well too, though they are less common. It's always better to have options when it comes to cooking, whether for dietary restrictions, an attempt at healthy eating or even a lack of ingredients in your pantry! As I learn new facets of ingredients, I think it's important to understand the versatility of kitchen items. Especially given the rising price of vegetable oil around the world, as Ukraine faces extreme conditions as one of food oil's biggest exporters. Tag us @ucsbonthemenu on Instagram if you try out any of these baking substitutions, or if you have any of your own!

on-the-menu,Letter From The Editor: My Time With On The Menu,26-May-22,3:30 PM,['Michelle Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-26/letter-from-the-editor-my-time-with-on-the-menu/,"Michelle Lee / Daily Nexus I joined the Daily Nexus in April 2020 î aka the peak of the pandemic and inception of Zoom University. Having been laid off from a previous on-campus job and moving back home, I had unprecedented free time and a newfound sense of loneliness that urged me to try something new. I came across that something one day while skimming through my Instagram and coming across a recruitment ad for the Daily Nexus.† I eagerly filled out the Google Form to become a writer, making the decision to join the news team. After having written a few news articles, I came to the conclusion that while I respect the craft of news reporting, it wasn't for me. I took a brief hiatus from the Nexus until September 2020, when I came across another Nexus recruitment ad, this one specifically for On the Menu. I was immediately intrigued, as I've always considered food to be an integral part of my life. Food has been and continues to be my main way of connecting with my family and, on a larger level, my Korean heritage. This has been especially crucial, as I have always felt a sense of imposter syndrome within Korean culture, growing up in America and speaking broken Korean. Without fail, the first thing my grandma always asks me (in Korean) when I visit home is, What do you want to eat?ù Eating the dishes my grandma and my mom prepare î doenjang jjigae, jeon, gaejang and more î I am able to not only feel their love but also reassure myself that I am equally Korean as I am American. To me, food is so much more than just food î food is family, love and connection. Writing for On the Menu, I was given an outlet to further explore and share my connections to food, which I am eternally grateful for. Having served as co-editor for On the Menu, I was able to go beyond this and learn about other people's unique experiences and connections with food. From family recipes to alternative eating reviews, every article that I had the privilege of reading, editing and publishing offered a new perspective on food that in turn enriched my own.† Above all, my time as co-editor for On the Menu has strengthened my belief that food is so much more than sustenance î it's a bridge between cultures, an agent for change, a creative outlet, a lens into another person's life, and the list goes on. While my time as co-editor for this amazing section has come to an end, I will carry this belief with me throughout my life and look forward to seeing what On the Menu accomplishes in the future.

on-the-menu,Secret Bao: Modern Asian Cuisine,31-May-22,1:26 PM,['Celine Pun'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-31/secret-bao-modern-asian-cuisine/,"Located on 1201 Anacapa Street, Secret Bao is a modern Asian cuisine restaurant in a quieter part of downtown Santa Barbara. Just like most restaurants in this area, Secret Bao is unfortunately closed on Mondays, Tuesdays and 2:30 to 5 p.m. Service is casual: customers order at the counter and seat themselves, and because there is a smaller staff, the menu is also smaller. During slow lunch hours, customers can watch the staff prep for dinner: mass chopping shiitake mushrooms, refilling the bar and even hand-pleating dumplings. Secret Bao is the perfect place to dine with friends since the dishes are easily sharable. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Walking into the restaurant, the ambiance exceeds expectations. Wine bottles stand in neat lines, art dangles on crisp walls and a wide variety of music î like BTS and Imagine Dragons î plays in the background. They also offer dog treats and water bowls for any furry friends you choose to bring. On the other hand, their full-service dining for dinner is exciting. Their patio seating has fairy lights, creating a romantic ambiance. Because it is full-service, reservations are recommended.† Secret Bao also has an impressive selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. They have a few beers on tap, an assortment of teas, coffee from Handlebar Coffee Roasters and a variety of cocktails with Asian twists. My favorite non-alcoholic drink is their CBD ginger lemonade, from VYBES. It is a very mellow drink with a gentle spiciness.† The Chicken Katsu sandwich consists of a stack of hokkaido milk bread, chicken katsu, bacon, slaw and bulldog sauce. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus I have ordered almost everything on their menu, but because they have a lot of dishes inspired by local and seasonal ingredients, the menu often changes. If I am ordering for one, I like to order a bao as an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. I usually go for their japchae, chili noodles or udon carbonara. I'm a noodles kind of person, and Secret Bao makes noodles like nobody else.† With a group, my favorite way to dine is by ordering a bunch of food and sharing. I love splitting a kalbi bossam, hamachi tartare, seasonal dumplings, gyoza and their specials with friends. You cannot leave this place without ordering one (or all) of their iconic baos, which are made fresh everyday. Bao selections include pork belly, Korean fried chicken, shrimp and Spanish octopus. During Pride month last year, they dyed their baos rainbow. Always ask them what their secret bao is. Sometimes, it's my favorite fried mushroom bao. Sea Scallop Crudo, a seafood entree available on the Secret Bao dinner menu. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Their desserts are stunning and always changing. I have loved their matcha cr√©me br√ªl√©e, Mexican chocolate pie and sticky date cake. I always get their bingsu, a Korean shaved ice, which can only be ordered when dining in and changes flavors often. I have also previously tried their matcha strawberry and orangesicle flavors. Right now, run for their mango sticky rice and churro & horchata flavors. If you are celebrating a birthday, they send a complimentary house-made chocolate.† Next time I go back, I hope to bring more friends to share their amazing demonstration of modern Asian food!

on-the-menu,Reflecting on PLNT PWRD MRKT's Short Time in Montecito,16-Jun-22,10:21 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-06-16/reflecting-on-plnt-pwrd-mrkts-short-time-in-montecito/,"Even today, with the growing popularity of plant-based diets, grocery shopping as a plant-based eater poses its challenges, especially at big-box stores. Meatless products are often overpriced and understocked. Plant-based products are scattered across many aisles; finding the exact items you need turns regular shopping into a scavenger hunt. After noticing the limited selection of plant-based products in larger supermarkets, Santa Barbara locals Tim and Kami Morton-Smith and Sam Benon saw this struggle for plant-based eaters as a business opportunity and opened PLNT PWRD MRKT, a plant-based market in Montecito.† An assortment of vegan and paleo-friendly snacks filled one of the many shelves in the market. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Specialty markets are a growing niche in the food industry. During the pandemic, many people went through lifestyle changes and reevaluated their health, creating a higher demand for healthier products that could also accommodate different diets. Benon has a strong sense of how to operate a market; his family has been involved in the grocery business for 40 years, Benon himself having worked for Trader Joe's for a considerable amount of time. He joined forces with Morton-Smith, who introduced the business idea, and the duo set out to open the first plant-based market in Santa Barbara County. Morton-Smith emphasized that PLNT PWRD MRKT was created to introduce people to plant-based eating in a way that was approachable, exciting and accepting. PLNT PWRD MRKT hoped to bring in regular customers who were plant-based or meat eaters with open minds.† I visited the store the weekend before it closed and felt both comfortable and excited by the displays of interesting products I had only ever seen on my Instagram feed. An inviting decal that spelled out Discover the Alternativesù stretched across the front window. Sleek, white shelves housed various plant-based baking mixes, spreads, superfood powders and vegan cookbooks. A wall of faux foliage and a PLNT PWRD MRKTù neon sign decorated the back wall.  A custom neon sign behind the cash register was created for the market. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus There were no overcrowded aisles, disorienting fluorescent lighting or bulky shopping carts. It was incredibly easy to see every item, unlike in a big-box store where products are often piled on top of each other and tucked away in the depths of each shelf. PLNT PWRD MRKT had a variety of refrigerated goods, such as oat milk, vegan cheeses and kombucha that were housed in coolers around the store. Themed display tables in the middle of the store highlighted specific products that customers might have typically glanced over while shopping. There was a vegan bath and body table and another table with a selection of artisanal cooking oils and seasoning. Each display felt very intentional and thoughtful. I left with a jar of Oat Haus Granola Butter and an Olipop Sparkling Tonic. This was the pleasant experience I had been longing for when grocery shopping.† A themed display of vegan bath and body products was arranged on a table at the front of the store. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus In my conversation with the founders, we discussed the difficulties of operating a market for a specific audience in Montecito during the pandemic. Morton-Smith and Benon signed a one-year lease in 2021 to test the success of the business. Due to unexpected delays with obtaining a health permit and setting up the store, PLNT PWRD MRKT opened a few months behind schedule in December of 2021 and closed June 3 of this year. Morton-Smith and Benon emphasized that the space for the store was intentional; PLNT PWRD MRKT was located adjacent to the Montecito Country Mart, an upscale shopping center with wealthy clientele î the type of place where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle might frequent. The store was just a few feet away from Vons, which the store owners believed to be an advantage. We needed to be an extra stop on people's grocery runs,ù Morton-Smith explained. He expected shoppers to visit the storefront for any plant-based products they couldn't find at Vons.† Despite the favorable location, foot traffic around the store was lower than expected. Combined with expensive Montecito rent and inflation that drove up prices, it was hard to keep the novelty store open for longer than the lease allowed. In this new age still affected by the ongoing pandemic, customers are still more likely to visit a one-stop shop or to order groceries online rather than shop at a store that has such a limited selection. However, Morton-Smith and Benon were still able to recognize the several goals they had achieved while operating this plant-based market. PLNT PWRD MRKT has brought upcoming brands to the store's shelves and presented plant-based eating in a fun, creative way that accepts all types of customers without an ounce of judgment.†

The many textures of the dish î the crunchy tortilla, the creamy bean base and the slightly crisp pickled vegetables î layer together to make a refreshing bite.† While I've had many tostadas in my lifetime, I have loved making this recipe from the comfort of my kitchen. The recipe is from Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook Vegan, at Times: 120+ Recipes for Every Day or Every So Often.ù Seinfeld's approach to veganism really resonated with me as I am also a person who predominantly eats plants, but am not strictly vegan either. The cookbook has 120+ recipes that are rather simple yet elevated. Additionally, if you are cooking for meat-eaters, it is incredibly easy to add animal protein to any of these dishes; I ended up creating an adaptation of this recipe for the non-vegans in my life. Black Bean Tostadas with Pickled Cabbage† Ingredients (serves 4) Pickled onion and cabbage Bean Mixture Tostadas To garnish Directions This recipe is sure to be a family favorite, but some people just aren't a fan of beans. For a beanless option, lay down a base of smashed avocado and add your protein of choice. Sauteed shrimp with a simple seasoning pairs nicely with the other components of the dish. I'm a strong proponent of curating your own cookbook collection. As mentioned in a review of Samah Dada's Dada Eats Love to Cook It,ù cookbooks are great tools for home chefs, even if the book's recipes aren't overly ambitious. When you break it down, Seinfeld's tostada recipe is made up of just three components but really packs in the flavor. Vegan, at Times: 120+ Recipes for Every Day or Every So Oftenù doesn't overcomplicate vegan cooking, making it a staple cookbook in my collection.† †

While my dad was young, he spent every Sunday with my great-grandparents, Nonno and Nonna, and often spent summers with my extended family in Italy, where he developed a love for Italian cuisine. My dad wove this passion for food into my childhood, too, taking everything he learned over the years and passing it on to my sisters and me.†  Being the die-hard dessert person I am, I always gravitated toward my Nonna's Sunshine Cake once I started experimenting in the kitchen on my own. This sponge cake is quick and simple to make, and a perfect summer treat for those who don't love cavity-level sweetness in their desserts. The secret ingredient is fresh orange juice, just enough to give the cake more complexity without overpowering the overall flavor. Sunshine cake is great served on its own, with a side of fresh fruit or î if you're feeling fancy î dressed up with an orange zest glaze to add an extra punch of citrusy goodness. My family eats it for breakfast (why pass up an excuse to have cake for breakfast?), but this dessert is also a perfect no-fuss option for any summer event.† Sunshine Cake Recipe: Ingredients:† Directions: Glaze Recipe:† Ingredients:† Instructions:† If you're looking for a crowd pleaser this summer, give this one a try!

on-the-menu,Navigating Food Insecurity at UCSB: A Resource Guide,25-Aug-22,12:59 PM,"['Stephanie Gerson', 'Chace Duma']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-08-25/navigating-food-insecurity-ucsb-resource-guide/,"One of the hardest adjustments that come with moving away from home is the seemingly simple task of feeding yourself. It's an expensive undertaking, especially now, given the current state of our economy. Getting the fresh produce and healthy foods one needs to fuel their body can be tough on a strict budget. Luckily, UC Santa Barbara and the surrounding community have a ton of resources for making sure you're well fed, no matter what your bank account is looking like. Unfortunately, some of these resources don't get the spotlight they deserve, so we've compiled this list in hopes to prepare students for any food insecurity the coming months and years might bring.† The A.S. Food Bank is located adjacent to SB Printer at the UCen. Students can register to obtain free groceries.† Associated Students Food Bank: Located by the print shop on the top floor of the UCen, the A.S. Food Bank is an essential resource for all UCSB students. The A.S. Food Bank offers a diverse selection of fresh produce, canned goods, snacks and other basics, such as toiletries. The best part? It's entirely free! Students may come once each day to grab as much food as they want. There are limitations on some items, like bread and toiletries, but produce is unlimited! Just be mindful that others need to use the food bank as well. The registration process is simple and quick and can even be done right outside the door. Currently, they're only open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, but once fall quarter begins, they'll be open Monday through Friday. Sign up as soon as you can and start saving money on groceries!† UCSB Greenhouse Garden Project: Want to grow your own food but you live in a dorm or apartment without space to plant? Look no further than the Greenhouse Garden Project! Located on the west side of campus near Harder Stadium, the Greenhouse Garden Project offers students a place to grow their own produce. Simply send an email to ghgpucsb@gmail.com to acquire a plot, and you can grow whatever (organic) produce you want î as long as you're able to put in a few hours each quarter doing work maintaining the garden. I did this my freshman year and loved the opportunity! Isla Vista Community Gardens & Sue√±o Orchard: There are a few places around Isla Vista where food is grown for the community. There are two community gardens: the Methodist Garden at the corner of Sue√±o Road and Camino Del Sur which, among a ton of other produce, has a huge passionfruit vine, and the Saint Michael's University Church Garden at the corner of Picasso Road and Camino Pescadero. Both of these gardens are open to harvesting from the public, and although they're popular, they're good places to grab some herbs or, if you're lucky, some produce. The Methodist Garden even has a peach tree that produces tons of fruit in the summer. Speaking of trees, the Sue√±o Orchard is another great place to harvest some food for free. Located on the 67 block of Sue√±o Road, the orchard has over 60 trees to pick from, including avocado, lime, apple, mulberry and many more. When these trees are in season, there's tons of fruit to go around, so make sure to walk by the orchard every once in a while and check what's growing!† The Isla Vista Food Co-op is just one of the stores that accepts EBT. Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus CalFresh and EBT: Did you know the state of California can fund your weekly trips to Trader Joe's? Through the CalFresh program, eligible students that fit the criteria on the CalFresh website can receive up to $250 per month for groceries. CalFresh benefits are issued through an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card. The EBT card can be used on any cold food item at a wide range of grocery stores, such as the Isla Vista Food Cooperative, Trader Joe's and Costco. EBT cards can also be used at farmers' markets in the Goleta and Santa Barbara area. Students can apply to the CalFresh program here or seek assistance by sending an email to thrive@ucsb.edu.† Kosher and Halal Grocery Program: UCSB's Kosher and Halal Grocery Program provides free, weekly groceries for students who keep Halal and Kosher to address the lack of Halal- and Kosher-friendly food options on campus and in Isla Vista. Partnerships with the A.S. Food Bank, Isla Vista Food Co-op and the Food Security & Basic Needs Taskforce have made this program possible. Undergraduate and graduate students who keep a Halal or Kosher diet are invited to apply for free groceries by using this Google form.† Food Not Bombs: Food Not Bombs (FNB) simultaneously combats food insecurity and food waste. The global nonprofit organization believes that food access is a basic human right. The organization has a chapter in Isla Vista that regularly provides free vegan and vegetarian meals to community members. Students are also welcome to volunteer at FNB events and can email foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com to get further involved in their community. FNB's Isla Vista chapter works with the Isla Vista Food Co-op and local farmers in order to save perfectly viable food that would otherwise be discarded. Their events are commonly held at Little Acorn Park. Visit their Instagram page for more information on how to obtain free meals and participate in other community events! Food Not. Bombs helped bring forth a community fridge in I.V. for everyone to use. Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus Isla Vista Community Fridge: Founded by a Food Not Bombs organizer, the community fridge on the corner of Embarcadero del Norte and Cervantes Road is open to all. Community members are invited to both take and contribute food from the fridge in order to keep it stocked at all times, similar to a lending library. The fridge receives regular donations from Food Not Bombs and Local Harvest Delivery. Their Instagram is updated with photos of the food available inside the fridge. While the community fridge does not take the place of a trip to the grocery store, it provides the Isla Vista community with fresh food that may be difficult for some to access.† Spending hundreds of dollars on groceries each month is a luxury. Now, more than ever, affordable, fresh food is less accessible than it was even a few years ago due to inflation, supply chain issues and even climate change. Shedding light on food access resources and letting friends, classmates and family learn how to utilize these programs can help remove the stigma around food insecurity and truly address this issue. Hopefully, with this list, students can use these helpful resources to obtain more affordable, or even free, groceries and meals or learn how to support others in the UCSB community. With all the other stressors that come with being a full-time student, obtaining nutritious food should never be one of them.†

And, yes, yes, I know. We live in California, where pretty much everything is in season all the time. But summer fruit just hits differently. Maybe it's the freedom of having time to visit farmers markets and get the freshest ingredients, or lazily watching sunsets at the end of warm days. Regardless, the best thing to do with fruit (and an abundance of it, I mean) is to eat it for every meal. And, you can! Nobody is going to stop you, especially me î unless you take my mangoes (my secret and favorite ingredient in this salad). This isn't your average Sunday brunch fruit salad. There are no grapes or apples or discolored bananas here. And, definitely, no straggler pieces of honeydew floating in unknown liquid at the bottom of the bowl. This nectarine basil salad is an elevated dish, a quick and satiating rush of flavors. The heat from roasted chickpeas, jalape√±o and Thai basil match the cool sweetness of the crisp nectarines, tomatoes and oh-so-smooth Ata√∫lfo mangoes.† Ingredients: Directions: This dish will have you inspired to make fruit-based salads for every meal. It's packed with protein, vitamins and colorful flavor that's sure to impress every taste bud. Tag @ucsbonthemenu on Instagram with your take!

on-the-menu,Hummus Republic: Mediterranean Fast Casual Comes to I.V.,22-Sep-22,10:00 AM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-22/hummus-republic-mediterranean-fast-casual-comes-to-i-v/,"Hummus Republic, a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant, opened at the end of May 2022, filling the space at 6546 Pardall Road that was previously occupied by the thought-to-be infallible Blaze Pizza.† I was cautiously excited when I first learned what would be replacing my beloved Blaze. Hummus Republic, at first glance, appeared reminiscent of one of my hometown favorites, CAVA, a similar Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant with many locations throughout Southern California. CAVA was my go-to back home for a quick, delicious meal, and I lacked a spot like that in Isla Vista.† A Hummus Republic bowl containing beets, cucumbers, tomatoes, kalamata olives, chicken shawarma, hummus, herbs and lemon olive oil dressing. Chace Duma / Daily Nexus  I was excited for a little more variety in the Isla Vista food scene; it'd be nice to have an option outside Mexican food, Asian food, pizza or miscellaneous drunchies. The caution, of course, came from three years of living in I.V., being disappointed by mediocre food sold at expensive prices.† After a long wait spent salivating at the sign on the empty building, Hummus Republic finally opened on May 26, 2022. I've had it twice since its opening, both experiences being pretty positive.† Entering the restaurant, you're met with the beginning of their bar where you start your order. At each station along the bar, there's a list of options in the corner with each option marked with symbols denoting if they're vegan, gluten-free, organic and hormone-free. As someone who can't eat gluten or dairy and tries to eat organic and hormone-free as much as possible, I really appreciated this touch. Small details like this are an easy way to make a customer feel more comfortable and confident in what they're eating.† I started my trip around the bar by opting for a bowl, the only option for someone who can't eat gluten. My only disappointment with their menu came right afterward when I was asked to select a base. They offer five options: couscous, garbanzo beans, kale, mixed greens and spinach, allowing you to mix and match as you please. Couscous, the only grain offered as a base, is made of wheat and, therefore, contains gluten. I was looking forward to the heartiness that comes with a base made of grains but unfortunately had to opt for a couple of handfuls of the mixed greens instead. Given their allergen consciousness, I was surprised at their decision not to offer another, more dietarily inclusive grain like rice.† Next, you saddle up to their spreads section. You're allowed up to three ice cream-size scoops of their six spreads. I opted for the traditional hummus, kalamata olive hummus and harissa hummus. After that, you round the corner to their protein section. They offer three meat-based proteins and three plant-based proteins î an even split, which is rare! I opted for the chicken shawarma. Next comes the toppings section, where you can really get creative. Hummus Republic offers over 15 toppings and you can choose as many as you want, the only limit being the size of your vessel. I chose the beets, cucumbers, tomatoes, kalamata olives and fresh herbs. I also chose the dolmades, which cost a dollar extra for two. Finally, you have your choice of six dressings. I opted for the simple lemon and olive oil. Overall, my bowl cost $15.36.† So, how'd it taste? Great! While you can certainly pick and choose your bites, I mixed everything together. This way, the hummus coats every single bite of chicken, beet, olive, cucumber, etc., adding a wonderful creamy texture and flavor. I love Mediterranean food for its freshness, and Hummus Republic didn't disappoint; it's exactly what I was looking for in a new I.V. restaurant. It's healthy and delicious, and it's sure to become a regular for me.†

on-the-menu,A more sophisticated take on the classic PB&J,22-Sep-22,10:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-22/a-more-sophisticated-take-on-the-classic-pbj/,"You can enjoy this sandwich open-faced or add arugula in between the two slices of bread. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus During the school year, I always struggle with lunch. Sure, there are lots of options on campus and in Isla Vista if you're in need of a quick bite, but trying to order a Subway sandwich in a timely fashion at the Arbor at peak lunch time is nearly impossible. Typically, I resort to packing up my leftovers from last night's dinner in a sad tupperware. Let me tell you, eating cold pasta outside the library before rushing to lecture is not exactly the best lunchtime vibe.† When I was younger, eating lunch at school seemed so seamless. An adult packed my lunch, and my palate was simple and underdeveloped. I probably ate hundreds of PB&Js during elementary and middle school and never got tired of it. Now that I'm older, I'm yearning for that same convenience but with some added maturity. After trying a similar sandwich at The Picnic Basket in Santa Cruz, I knew I had to recreate it.† This PB&J for grown-ups has everything that you loved as a kid with an elevated twist. Swap the sugary Smucker's jam for sweet, roasted red beets; swap the Jif peanut butter for almond butter; invest in some good, local bread; add a few other accouterments and you have yourself a delicious sandwich that would make 10-year-old you wince but future you extremely proud.† Ingredients (makes 1 sandwich): For the most flavorful beets, head to your local farmers market. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Directions: As college students, we all have busy schedules. Finding time to prepare a nice sandwich isn't always easy, especially during the middle of the day when you're tasked with a million other things to do. However, parts of this sandwich can be prepped at the start of the week to make life easier. Roast the beets and create the chickpea spread on the weekend so by the time Monday rolls around, you'll feel organized and prepared. Here's to improving lunchtime one sandwich at a time!

Maya Salem / Daily Nexus As I confront the end of summer, I don't want to say goodbye to the light and healthy meals that somehow link themselves with the sunny season. I just won't. So here's something quick enough to whip up on a busy night: a mushroom steak. This meatless option will lure you in with its simplicity and ensnare you with its complexity. There's not so much of a secret to a well-seasoned portabella mushroom, but rather a game. Simply play with the unique earthy flavors. This one is infused with Middle Eastern flavors (also known as my parents' spice cabinet), such as red sumac î not to be confused with its very poisonous cousin with a white berry î whose tangy flavor profile compliments za'atar, a spice mixture of herbs and sesame seeds. Together, these flavors bring out a sort of moxie from the portabella mushroom. Lain across a sultry bed of hummus and outfitted with some lemony broccolini? Say no more.† Ingredients: Mushrooms: † Broccolini: † Directions: † This dish is full of fresh flavors and hearty goodness. (That is, of course, if you like portabellas.

Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus† Every year, Goleta's largest festival attracts over 40,000 enthusiastic visitors. Perfect for young families, dozens of kid-friendly attractions can be accessed with a surprisingly cheap $5 wristband. The festival featured attractions including mini golf, water hamster balls, a climbing tower, bungee jumping, bouncy slides and houses, a mini Ferris wheel and a small train ride.† Over 80 local craftsmen and companies hosted booths along the park walkways, using prize wheels and free merchandise to drum up business. A large central tent sold lemon festival T-shirts, tumblers, hats and more. Santa Felicia Drive, which runs alongside the park, was barricaded to host a fleet of emergency vehicles and other booths celebrating Goleta's first responders. The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office handed out stickers, EMTs offered crash courses in CPR and firemen let children climb in their trucks. Anna's Bakery sold lemon bars and lemon meringue pie at their booth. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The most popular attraction, however, remained the food court area. As for the lemon-themed bill of fare, there were lemon churros, lemon meringue pie, lemon bars, lemonade, lemon tamales and lemon beer. Other available cuisines included chili dogs, potato swirls, curly fries, Rusty's Pizza Parlor, a√ßai bowls, tacos and ice cream. The $5 large lemon bar was worth every penny. Though, the $10 potato swirl and $5 strawberry lemonade could not similarly justify their price. Sitting across from the vendors and rides, the Goleta Fall Classic Car Show displayed dozens of restored vintage vehicles. Each vehicle sported a placard with the make, model and build date; some spirited car owners even hung around their cars to answer questions and chat with passersby. Many of the cars had popped hoods and doors, allowing curious visitors to peek at their shiny interiors.† The main event was the meringue pie eating contest. In the first of two rounds, 10 children under 12 years old competed to see who could consume the most pie in one minute. The catch: No hands or utensils were allowed. Each kid was provided a hairnet and a poncho before digging in. The end result was lemon curd carnage everywhere. The 12-and-up group took the stage next, where 10 adults competed to finish an entire pie.† Local musicians and performers got their chance to take the stage once the pie remnants were cleared away. One featured band was WhoseHouseIsThis?, a local high school rock band with some impressive covers. Shaded picnic tables surrounded the stage, allowing visitors to listen as they ate. Overall, attending the Goleta Lemon Festival was the perfect way to spend the first weekend of fall. With novelty food, entertainment, music and free gifts, there was something for everyone.

on-the-menu,Two refreshing mocktail recipes and a discussion about the nonalcoholic beverage market,7-Oct-22,10:06 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-07/two-refreshing-mocktail-recipes-and-a-discussion-about-the-nonalcoholic-beverage-market/,"I'd consider myself a beverage fanatic. On any given day, you can catch me with a unique grouping of beverages î my trusty Hydro Flask filled with water and ice cubes that make the most annoying sound when I walk, a thermos of day-old coffee and another drink just for fun, most likely something fizzy or fermented, like kombucha. My latest drink obsession has been making mocktails, fueled by my love for fun drinks and recent discovery of a community of mocktail mixologists on TikTok.††† I feel like most nonalcoholic drink options are limited to juice, soda or plain water. But sometimes you want an interesting, creative drink that won't result in a debilitating hangover (just typing that word gave me flashbacks). More recently, I've noticed an expansion of zero-proof drink options in grocery stores, restaurants and even bars. I sense a culture shift happening to a more understanding and supportive attitude toward those who abstain from alcohol. From alcohol-free beer to gin alternatives and premixed mocktails, skipping out on alcohol can still be fun, flavorful and accessible. I wanted to share some of my go-to mocktail recipes that taste pretty darn similar to the real thing.† Grapefruit Moscow Mule Serve your Moscow Mule in a pre-chilled copper mug! Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus This drink gets most of its flavor from Saint Ivy's Non-Alcoholic Moscow Mule beverage. I found this premixed drink at Whole Foods Market, and while the price for a pack of four bottles was ridiculous, I decided to be adventurous and try it anyway. Saint Ivy specializes in nonalcoholic, sparkling cocktails available in three flavors: Moscow Mule, Gin and Tonic and Mint Mojito. The brand created these drinks to help nondrinkers feel more included in social gatherings that typically involve alcohol, which is something I definitely support.† Ingredients (makes 1 drink): Directions:†† Chamomile and Blueberry Mojito with Lavender Syrup This drink's vibrant purple color comes from the blueberry and lavender infused simple syrup. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus I created this second mocktail recipe with relaxation and stress relief in mind. While a mojito typically consists of rum, lime juice, simple syrup and mint, this nonalcoholic mojito has floral undertones from the muddled blueberries and sweet lavender simple syrup. It's the more fun version of the warm mug of chamomile and lavender tea I often drink at night. Plus, the lavender simple syrup used in this recipe is pretty versatile: Try mixing some into your coffee to make a lavender latte or incorporate it into baked goods.† Ingredients (makes 1 drink): Lavender Simple Syrup (makes Ω cup): Mocktail: Directions: Experimenting with mocktail recipes is great and all, but what about the times when you're out with friends and don't want to drink? The zero-proof drink market is already saturated with a diverse selection of spirits, mixers and brews. However, I think there's still room for grocery stores, popular beverage companies, bars and restaurants to improve and expand their alcohol-free options. Since the wellness beverage craze exploded during the pandemic, more brands are jumping on the bandwagon but often using the demand for more health-conscious drinks as an excuse to rebrand their existing products as exciting nonalcoholic beverages. By distinguishing certain beverages as alluring alternatives for nondrinkers, brands can charge more for these specialty items. † Santa Cruz Organic's Radiant Ros√© is sold at an affordable price but skimps out on flavor. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus A prime example of this deceptive marketing is Santa Cruz Organic's Radiant Ros√©: a bottle of sparkling grape juice. The drink looks just like any other bottle of ros√© but doesn't have the same slight bitterness and distinct flavor of a sparkling wine. Santa Cruz Organic wins customers over with eye-catching packaging for their line of wine alternatives, yet the ingredient lists are nearly identical to their basic white grape juice product that costs less. Radiant Ros√© is an adequate substitute for wine or champagne if you need something to toast with, but don't expect it to dazzle your tastebuds and compete with your favorite sparkling wine.† Observing brands' and supermarkets' commitment to offering zero-proof products shows that abstaining from alcohol has become slightly more accepted, even though it might seem like we have a long way to go before all establishments begin serving the niche nonalcoholic drinks found at specific stores. I acknowledge that this acceptance of sobriety might not be apparent at a school like UC Santa Barbara where drinking is the preferred activity among students, but it seems that judgment toward nondrinkers has slightly decreased over the years. While the nonalcoholic beverage market improves and releases more affordable and creative products, my Moscow mule and mojito recipes can serve you in the meantime. Cheers!

on-the-menu,Oyster Mushroom Faux Chicken Tenders,14-Oct-22,11:47 AM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-14/oyster-mushroom-faux-chicken-tenders/,"Chace Duma / Daily Nexus I'm trying to eat less meat. About a year ago, I tried to go vegan for a week and it didn't go too well. However, just because veganism didn't work doesn't mean I'm eating a steak at every meal. I'm still making an effort to eat less meat, for personal health reasons and, mainly, the health of our planet. According to analysis by the Chatham House, eating less meat is essential to curbing climate change, which makes complete sense when considering that global greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based foods are twice those of plant-based foods. Beyond the impact going meatless once or twice a week will have on our planet, I've found that pushing myself to eat more plant-based meals requires me to be more creative in the kitchen, which is always a welcome challenge. This recipe for oyster mushroom tenders is no exception! It's a delicious (and cheaper) replacement for your classic chicken tenders. It's way easier, too, with no fussing over whether your chicken is cooked or not! Bread the mushrooms, throw them in the oil until they're perfectly golden brown, let them cool, then dig in!† Ingredients: Directions: If you're feeling like adding another layer of flavor (not that these need it) feel free to dip your mushroom nuggets into ketchup, soy sauce or one of your other favorite dipping sauces. They're delicious on their own; I was eating them so quickly I didn't even consider a dip. If you're looking to reduce your meat intake, add this recipe to your quick weeknight dinnersù list or just do something with that bunch of oyster mushrooms you bought at the farmers market because of how pretty they looked, this is a delicious option!

on-the-menu,Kick off Soup Season with a Cozy Bowl of Broccoli Soup,14-Oct-22,11:52 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-14/kick-off-soup-season-with-a-cozy-bowl-of-broccoli-soup/,"Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Last week's foggy and cold weather ushered in autumn, meaning different things for different people. Whether it meant it was time to start rewatching Gilmore Girls,ù ordering pumpkin spice lattes or searching up Halloween costume ideas, fall has plenty of cozy things in store. For me, it signaled the start of my favorite time of year: soup season. Tomato, Italian wedding, clam chowder, butternut squash î you name it, I love it. Don't even get me started on the wonders of sourdough bread bowls.† But I can't deny that broccoli soup has a special place in my heart. There's something inherently comforting about the earthy, cheesy flavors. I grew up stopping by Panera Bread after winter soccer games for a quick cup of soup to warm me up. Unfortunately for Isla Vista residents, the closest Panera is about 40 miles away in Ventura, meaning it's up to you to recreate their classic cup of broccoli cheddar. Luckily, my mom's broccoli soup recipe is here to save the day. While it's not a total replica of Panera's hit recipe, the twist of Gruy√®re and nutmeg, dare I say, puts it over the top. As an added bonus, this easy recipe packs in two types of vegetables. And if you hate broccoli, try swapping it out with cauliflower. Either way, the next time your parents call, you can make them proud and say you've actually eaten a vegetable in the past 24 hours.† Broccoli Soup Total Time: 1 hour, 10 minutes† Servings: 4 Ingredients:† Directions: The next time you finish a long day of classes and bike rides in the cold, warm yourself up with a cozy blanket and a cup of soup. I am definitely a part of the soup-and-grilled-cheese-combo fan club, but if you're feeling lazy, a slice of crusty bread is also perfect for dipping.

Operating a restaurant during the pandemic is no easy task; supply chain issues, rent increases, staffing shortages and inflation are just some of the challenges restaurant owners currently face. The ongoing pandemic has drastically altered the area's offerings, resulting in the closure of some beloved establishments. However, these closures also make room for new and inventive restaurants, breathing a new life into areas of Santa Barbara, Goleta and Isla Vista.† Isla Vista's Pizza My Heart shuts its doors One of I.V.'s three pizzerias permanently closed its only Southern California location in August, most likely due to expensive rent prices in Santa Barbara County. Pizza lovers will now have to choose between Woodstock's and Domino's to get their fix. There are no signs of new development in the restaurant space at this time. Checo's opens in Isla Vista I.V.'s new taco shop held their grand opening on Oct. 1. The opening day drew a large crowd of hungry students who sold out the restaurant by the end of the day.

Their new location will have a new lunch menu, pizza oven and more room for sit-down dining and possible collaborations with other local businesses. We recently visited the space, and the owner Louise Ulrich shared that their estimated opening date is sometime in November.† Harbor & Seafood Festival returns on Oct. 15 After two years, the Santa Barbara Harbor & Seafood Festival returns to the Santa Barbara Harbor Waterfront. The daylong event will include complimentary boat rides, live musical performances and, of course, lots and lots of seafood. Booths along the harbor will sell paella, fish tacos, fresh fish and more.

At least, that's what I tell myself. When I'm with my other Pinoy friends, I struggle to find a sense of belonging because my upbringing was very American in comparison. I do not speak even a tiny bit of Tagalog or Ilocano. I do not refer to my older sister as Ate, nor do I have a kuya. I grew up in an American household speaking English. However, the one thing that I feel I have a strong connection to culturally is Filipino food, which I hold dear to my heart.† My lola and lolo were always nearby, and whenever my mom didn't feel like cooking, she would take us to their house because they always had food on hand. My grandparents always had a variety of Filipino food, like arroz caldo and pancit, but one of my favorite things that they made for us was chicken adobo, which me and my siblings happily ate. Adobo always brought me comfort, the same comfort that I felt watching teleserye with my lola or helping my lolo with his garden in the backyard. This recipe is my attempt at recreating my lolo's chicken adobo and is easy and simple to make, as well as being warm and hearty, perfect for the fall and winter. Ingredients: Directions: Although time and distance makes visits to my grandparents few and far between, this recipe brings me the same sense of home that I feel when I'm with them. As a Filipino who didn't grow up in the most traditional household, I find that food helps bridge the disconnect I feel between being Filipino and being American. I hope that this recipe not only serves as an easy college-friendly meal but also as a comfort for any homesick Filipinos.†

Kyra Karatsu / Daily Nexus All things seafood and maritime, the free community event showcased the ocean's freshest ingredients. Food trucks and tents served up hot lobster rolls, fish tacos and clam chowder. A delicious, smoky aroma filled the air as talented chefs used massive pans to cook seafood paella, one of the most popular food items at the festival. Festival-goers were queued up in long lines to taste the delicious combination of shrimp, rice and clams that melted in their mouths. This carefully crafted masterpiece was both a mouth-watering treat and a display of cooking showmanship.† Local fishermen displayed their specialties on ice beds for all to see as well.

A fan favorite was Pacific Crepes, which were light, fluffy and captivated customers of all ages. The aesthetically crafted crepes were admired by all before being quickly devoured.† Accompanying the food vendors were local crafts and goods sold in tents near the harbor's entrance. From beaded jewelry to hats and clothing, shopping catered to all. One tent even sold handcrafted wizard wands, ranging in shape, size and color. Several of the vendors supported charities and notable causes. Mermaid Market reused traditional sari dresses to make quilts, while Hello Bag offered alternatives to plastic and paper bags.†† A face painting booth and free boat ride excursions aboard the Kelpie with Double Dolphin Cruises also kept festival-goers and, especially, their younger children well-entertained for the afternoon. Vendors weren't the only ones with booths set up for the festival. Maritime educators and organizations, such as Heal the Ocean and Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol enthusiastically gave out information and pamphlets to those interested. At the heart of the harbor, the event was completed with live music from Juan Dolor, Spencer the Gardner and Cornerstone. While their melodies floated across all corners of the venue, picnic tables around the main stage made way for an acoustic dining and dancing experience. Live painters later captured the felicitous scene with acrylic paint. Vendors from SB Seafood hold up a more than 30 lbs lobster for all to see.

Rushed last-minute trips to markets and the kosher butcher were thrilling as my mom and I prepared the traditional evening meal together. My mom would prepare and cook everything and anything from the root vegetables to the chicken schnitzel while I began proofing yeast and measuring out flour for fresh challah.† Making challah has been a part of my life since I can remember. From Jewish preschool and day school activities involving baking challahs on Friday nights to testing new challah and bread recipes in a test kitchen, it is as if baking challah is intrinsically linked to who I am. Nothing brings me pure nostalgia more than getting into the kitchen, braiding three-stranded loaves and getting to share my creations with other people. While baking challah is so second-nature to me at this point, I sought to challenge myself to develop a new challah recipe that incorporated fall flavors while enhancing my own bread-making skills. This is where I have conceptualized the pumpkin chocolate challah-babka, also known as the pumpkin chocolate babkallah.† My recipe is inspired by Claire Saffitz's babkallah from her cookbook, Dessert Person: Recipes and Guidance for Baking with Confidence: A Baking Book. Babka is a bread of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and is similar to challah in taste and structure. Combining the challah and babka recipes together results in an incredibly textured yeast bread similar to brioche. With varying seasonal adjustments through the incorporation of pumpkin puree and warm spices as well as chocolate spread stuffed in the dough, this pumpkin chocolate babkallah will be the best dessert you'll eat during this autumnal equinox.† Ingredients: For the dough: For the filling and assembly: Directions: The babkallah can be served hot or cold, eaten rain or shine.

on-the-menu,Perfect Pumpkin Fall Fudge,27-Oct-22,10:39 AM,['Haydin Zogaric'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-27/perfect-pumpkin-fall-fudge/,"Haydin Zogaric | Daily Nexus Like many others, my favorite time of year is autumn, with its fall flavors, cozy sweaters and the start of the holidays. At my family's small business, Shaws Candy in San Francisco, the fall feeling is captured by seasonal treats of all kinds: spooky Halloween candies, caramel apples, caramel praline and espresso toffee ice cream and our fall best seller: pumpkin spice fudge.† Fudge originated as an American classic during the late 1800s because of its ease and affordability. Recipes have been passed down through generations, and fudge has become especially renowned in areas of the U.S. South and Midwest, such as in Mackinac Island, Michigan î the home state of my mother, Diana. The nostalgia of fresh fudge and ice cream cones is what initially drove her to opening Shaws and reviving a favorite local spot for San Francisco families. At Shaws, we make our fudge fresh in-house every week with an industrial fudge kettle that creates the silky smooth texture that everybody loves. Although fudge is easy to make at home, on a professional level, every measurement must be accurate and each step must be precisely executed. First, sugar must be heated to the soft-ball stage, at 235 to 240 F, to prevent the crystallization of the sugar molecules and ensure a creamy, not grainy, texture. To test if your sugar has reached the soft-ball stage, drop some of the sugar mixture into cold water. If the result is a soft, malleable ball, you've successfully hit the mark. If your sugar syrup dissolves in water or forms a hard ball, you've under î or over î cooked your sugar. Next, our fudge base, butter, cream and any flavorings are added to the kettle and churned for multiple hours. Finally, any additions such as nuts or cookie bites are mixed in. We then pour the fudge into trays and decorate it with caramel swirl, chocolate drizzle or other toppings. We allow the fudge to rest for 24 hours before slicing and serving.† There's nothing that screams fallù more than melt-in-your-mouth pumpkin spice fudge. A single bite delivers the warmth and spice of pumpkin pie and evokes the elation of gatherings with friends and family. You may not own an industrial fudge kettle î no worries! Here's how to easily recreate pumpkin fudge at home: Ingredients: Directions: I hope you enjoy this autumn recipe for pumpkin spice fudge and give it a try on your own!

on-the-menu,"Life, death and biscuits: Navigating grief through food",3-Nov-22,9:57 AM,['Katherine McCabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-03/life-death-and-biscuits-navigating-grief-through-food/,"The food doesn't matter, really,ù writes Amanda Hesser, New York Times food editor, in her book Eat, Memory: Great Writers at the Table.ù What it evokes does.ù† Hesser is, of course, referring to one of food's most enchanting properties: its ability to conjure memory. A good meal succinctly combines all five senses, giving your brain multiple avenues to recall said meal. We eat a meal three times a day, granting us three chances to ground ourselves in the moment î or brood on the next. But nevertheless, it offers us the chance to slow down and harbor more enduring memories of the time, place and sentiment in which the meal is being consumed. Food is often a central part of a larger event or celebration. How do you celebrate Christmas? Your birthday? A first date, even? Food is likely one of the first things that comes up in all these hallmarks: a nexus of culture, tradition, family and survival. It sits at the center of awkward family reunions, middle school lunch periods, football games and job orientations. Friends and family bring home-cooked meals to the bereaved. A cake is cut at a wedding. Throughout it all, eating grounds us in the moments we live through.† Katherine McCabe / Daily Nexus I did not know that my last meal with my dad would be my last meal with my dad. At the time, I lived and worked about three hours away from my family in Sacramento. Getting only one day off a week, I seldom used it to make the commute there and back, but one day in August I did. I texted my family ahead of time, making sure my mom could run to the store to pick up some groceries for our dinner. It always went like this: Between timing and travel logistics, we also planned ahead so I could cook something special with my family while visiting. This time she picked up an assortment of our usual veggies as well as some crisp bok choy. We shared a stir-fry, the four of us: my mom, dad, brother and I. It was another (I say this humbly!) quite delicious meal to pocket as a cherished memory with family. Following my dad's leukemia diagnosis last year, I knew each moment together must be treasured, that the extra effort was worth it, was necessary. I hugged him goodbye early the next morning and left for work. He suffered a brain hemorrhage hours later. He died in the intensive care unit that weekend.† The mercy of cancer, to many, is its slowness. If you are given six months to live, that's six months î give or take î to make arrangements, say goodbyes. Everyone knows what they're in for. We were denied such mercy. My dad's cancer was not terminal, a treatment plan was still in place, we still had a hypothetical future to still cling to. Our time spent together did have an extra impetus to be treasured, but lacked finality. It felt like some kind of cosmic gift, or pure, gracious coincidence, that the one day I visited home was our last day with my dad. That I could hug him, laugh with him, tell him about my day one last time î that we are sharing that final meal, now and forever.† The whole two years of my dad's battle with cancer was marked by these special moments at the table. Between waves of grief I find comfort knowing that it ended with one. When my dad was first diagnosed, I made the decision to move back home to be with him. His first hospital stay was in January 2021 î a sudden implosion of our worlds made worse by pandemic-induced visiting restrictions, an extended round of chemo and complications with infections. When he finally came home, more than a month had passed. His discharge day was pushed back again and again, until finally I drove white-knuckled to the hospital to pick him up on Valentine's Day, and our family, whole again, shared a meal of bright pink, buttery beet gnocchi. I remember the give of the dough beneath my hands. I remember the giddy sprint of our Rottweiler upon seeing my dad at the door. I remember the crackle of fried sage, the salty tang of freshly shaved parmesan. I remember seeing my mom cry for the first time since her mom had passed. Moments were suspended, infinite, distilled î all over a single meal. Of course, you can't talk about food without discussing where it comes from. Taking interest in environmental justice and agricultural reform is often a depressing endeavor, given the precariousness of our food system in the face of climate change, abysmal farm labor conditions and our rapidly depleting topsoil, just to name a few. The effects of our broken food system are deep and far-reaching, and more than anything, urgent. I prefer not to think about the provenance of my dad's cancer, but it doesn't ease my mind that our ubiquitous processed foods are associated with a higher cancer risk; that the groundwater in the Sacramento Valley is both dwindling and contaminated; that glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, has been directly linked to leukemia. I am reminded of this daily by my targeted Instagram ads (Do you or a loved one have Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma? You may be entitled to financial compensation in the Monsanto Roundup lawsuit. No fee until you win!ù). I don't claim that any of these things are responsible for what happened to my dad, but there are certainly many casualties of our convoluted and reckless food system. Whether or not you can instantly connect any dots to your personal victimhood doesn't matter. My dad isn't the reason I became involved in food justice, but I do think it honors his memory to do work that I think is important. When I think of my dad î the things he taught me, meals we shared, of my love for him, for my family, for my community î I think of how fiercely and desperately I believe in a better world.† Sitting with my dad in the ICU before he passed, we cried, exchanged stories and did our best to comfort each other. No one in my family strictly follows any particular religion, though some of us, myself included, identify vaguely as spiritual. So, my dad is still with us always. Or we'll see him again. Or something like that. I remember reading that with each breath you take, in the billions and billions of molecules, you're inhaling at least some of the same air as Albert Einstein did,ù my uncle mused, about my dad's continued permanence on the planet.† I read the same thing about Leonardo da Vinci,ù my brother laughed. I read the same thing about Shakespeare,ù I said and squeezed my dad's hand.† In How to Eat,ù Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh writes: Our Ancestors Are in the Soilù That nut, fruit, vegetable, or grain that you eat has pulled up nutrition from the soil in order to grow. In the soil are many people who have died, have been transformed, and have become part of the soil. Maybe in this mouthful of rice are also the bones of many hundreds of generations as well as many dead leaves, worms, and animals' bones. Maybe in a previous †life you had been there and died there, and your own bones have disintegrated in that land. During the time of eating, your practice is to look deeply into that grain of rice and enjoy all that has gone into its creation. There are so many things to enjoy and to discover in each bite.ù It seems a little macabre at first, but isn't it also incredible? It's incredible that we can ascribe beauty in this world so boundlessly, that my dad, that our loved ones, are quite literally still with us in their basest forms, circling the globe as carbon or oxygen or a grain of rice. It seems too good to be true! All this love, our history, our ancestors, are all endlessly accumulating and cycling through each part of this world. In death we are then permitted to give back. The thought of returning to the kitchen, to our dining table, now set with only four plates, the devastating absence at the head of the table: It feels impossible at first. It is a head-on collision with grief. But through this it becomes a medium of memory, an opportunity not just to grieve but to remember and reconnect.† A few days after he passed, my dad's friend sent us pictures of him. In my favorite one they are sharing a meal, and my dad is grinning enormously and holding up a half-eaten burger like a prized catch. The picture is a live photo. I press down on my phone screen. He is shaking from the apparent pressure of holding in a laugh, keeping it together long enough for the moment to be captured. My dad is smiling, rosy-cheeked and still alive. Each time I sit down for a meal, I get to remember him this way.

on-the-menu,Why ratatouille is more than just a dish,3-Nov-22,10:01 AM,['Luc Le'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-03/why-ratatouille-is-more-than-just-a-dish/,"In the decade and a half since the film's release, ratatouille, once a modest commoner's meal, has risen to fame as a popular statement dish. Simone Mansell / Daily Nexus  There perhaps has been no dish whose reputation has been laundered more effectively by a piece of fiction than the humble ratatouille î the roasted vegetable casserole that formed the centerpiece of arguably the best film centered around a cooking rodent, Pixar's Ratatouille.ù If you somehow have managed to get this far in life without seeing the film, here is how it goes: At the film's climax, notoriously vile food critic Anton Ego arrives to review the restaurant helmed by protagonist Remy (a rat of remarkable culinary acumen). But instead of giving the elitist Ego an outwardly sophisticated dish from the world of haute French cuisine, Remy opts for a different choice: the titular dish prepared confit byaldi style, with thin rounds of sliced tomato, zucchini and eggplant shingled atop a sauce of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, onion and garlic and then baked î the flavors of which, as it turns out, reminds Ego of his mother's cooking, finally shattering his bitter, cold, critical veneer.† In the decade and a half since the film's release, ratatouille, once a modest commoner's meal, has risen to fame as a popular statement dish î and why wouldn't it be? It's gorgeous, with cascading, multicolored stripes circling its baking dish and an apparent delicateness when placed upon the plate with a spoonful of brilliant orange sauce encircling it. Ratatouille is a feast, as they say, for the eyes, perfectly suited to visual mediums like Instagram feeds, YouTube cooking videos and, yes, the silver screen. But it's also a dish that I'd wager most people haven't ever tried to make themselves î its need for copious amounts of thinly sliced and delicately arranged produce means that ratatouille, at least in its dressed-up film form, is too labor intensive for most people to do alone. But what are friends for, if not to help you make a dish from a movie about a cooking rodent? So on one of the last nights of the dying summer, we gathered at a friend's house on Del Playa Drive to answer a simple question: Is ratatouille as good as it looks?† Well, no. It's not bad (far from it, in fact), but it's not a dish that will blow you away by any means î and certainly not a dish that will give you flashbacks to your childhood and change your entire outlook on life with a single mouthful. Perhaps my disappointment can be attributed to the heightened expectations I had from the film. In the movie, the vegetable slices have a pliable, pleasing firmness to them; in real life the hour in the oven breaks them down to a soft, unremarkable mush that flops limply atop the tines of a fork. That brilliant orange sauce? It's aromatic, certainly, with a hint of bite and smoke from the charred peppers. Yet it is all a hint, all a suggestion. I find the intensive roasting processes used here, much like the rest of the dish, mellow these bright, distinctive, vegetal flavors down to the point of vaguity. It's all a bit one-note; I found myself wanting for something else î some acid, some spice, some robustness, some depth, some je ne sais quoi.ù I think that ratatouille's mild flavors are more suited toward a role as an appetizer or perhaps a side dish to support a more heavily flavored protein. But as the starring role? I don't think, given the labor required, it's quite worth it.† And yet. And yet. Isn't that what films are about? The fact that events, scenes, sequences must follow themselves, one after the other, no matter how dire the situation may seem. And yet î something must happen. There is no story otherwise. The lovers break up, and yet one runs to stop the other from boarding the airplane. Colette leaves after Linguini reveals his secret, and yet she returns to help save the restaurant. One door closes, and yet another opens. And yet. And yet. We are searching, always, for a twist in the narrative, another turn to the tale. So here is one.† The taste of ratatouille, I think, is largely irrelevant. You will eat plenty of better food in your life, I'm sure î more exciting, more dynamic cocktails of salt, fat, acid, heat. But the question of culinary value has a far simpler, more abstract explanation, even among those of us who have eaten enough good food to fill several lifetimes: As I've become older,ù the late Anthony Bourdain once said, I realize the food that I yearn for is the food I react to in an entirely emotional way.ù Research has shown that our memories and sense of taste are intimately intertwined; food, therefore, functions as a vessel for experience. A way to entrap memory and yet call it forth again; a pair of soft, warm hands stretching through time.† Think of the foods you have loved throughout your life: a childhood comfort food made by a parent, cheap fast food scarfed down after sports games or an indulgent, intimate date night dish made by a lover as you stand together under the kitchen light, slowly swaying. We love these things not so much for the way they dance across our tongues but the way they bring us back, at least for a moment, to a place that is impossible to return to, yet one we yearn for all the same. Nostalgia, from the Greek word nostosù: to return home.† For Ego, in the film, ratatouille tastes like his mother's love, a warm refugee from the angry, cruel world outside. Had I made it alone, ratatouille would taste, perhaps, like disappointment, loneliness, mismatched expectations and too many dishes to do. But here is what it tastes like to me: A day in which the sun is setting already when you arrive. One of your friends brings tomatoes grown from their backyard garden. You cook together in the too-small apartment kitchen, bouncing haphazardly between each others' orbits, chopping vegetables, charring peppers, dicing herbs. Nothing quite goes to plan. The zucchini is too big. The homegrown tomatoes are too delicate. It doesn't matter. You eat them straight off the board as they fall apart in your hands, sweet and succulent. You drink too much cheap wine from Trader Joe's. You talk and laugh about films, about music, about love. This is nourishment. After you put the ratatouille in the oven, you walk to the place where the lips of the beach kiss the ocean and watch the sun set: blue, yellow, orange, pink. After dinner, you sit on the couch outside and pass a cigarette around, health consequences be damned, because this is what being alive is: this moment in time, this smoke and sea mist that float upward toward nothing.† And yet,ù you think. You are broke. Your roommates have piled dirty dishes up in the sink. You have a paper due. You have laundry to do. The rest of your life stretches in front of you in dark, bifurcated paths. And you are searching, always, for something you cannot name, yet fear you may never find. Perhaps it is this.† So. This is how it goes: You drink more. You laugh. You fling off your clothes and run into the ocean. It is warm and salty. You lie on your back and paddle away from the shore. The cliffs above are a mournful static. The universe is a full moon hidden inside your left ventricle. Find yourself where the light catches you. You will never be here again.

on-the-menu,The flavor is: Naan Stop,10-Nov-22,12:47 PM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-10/the-flavor-is-naan-stop/,"Coming to UC Santa Barbara, I never expected to find î let alone stumble upon î an Indian restaurant so close to campus. Late at night within the first week of moving in, sitting under the harsh glow of the Rosarito sign, I suddenly found myself back at home: sizzling garlic naan in the oven, bubbling paneer butter masala in the pot, transported by a smell so familiar to my nose that suddenly bombarded me. I watched two people walk by with stacked styrofoam containers, a familiar foil shape on top and instinctively knew what they had just ordered. On the other end of the complex housing Rosarito, in a small, unassuming building with no flashy lights or hubbub, I found Naan Stop: Indian Food & Boba Tea. Their menu offers a tremendous variety of fried entrees, curries, breads, Indian desserts î the usual that I expected î but I was surprised by the selection of drinks. Typically, Indian restaurants limit their beverage options to the quintessential options: lassi, masala chai, water and perhaps soda. But boba tea? It was outside of their niche. Yet Naan Stop offers a variety of boba teas, including, but not limited to: Thai tea, green tea and snow bubble. Still, I opted for the classic mango lassi, which was a little thicker and more yogurty than expected but not unpleasant in the slightest, since the freshness of the mango carried through every small sip. The serving style resembles Chipotle, with the option of assembling a rice bowl or combo plate with assorted curries on display to the customer. Alternatively, diners can simply order a curry itself to accompany a bread of their choice. That night, I was told the full menu was off the table. I was only slightly disappointed that their extensive menu was reduced to the eight colorful curries before my eyes. However, this made the decision-making process a lot easier, since I knew beforehand what each curry looked like, smelled like and could imagine myself ordering it. I immediately gravitated toward the paneer tikka masala, a cream-and-tomato-based Indian curry with a nutty fullness and soft cubes of cottage cheese. I found the curry to be more watery in consistency than I was used to, but not at a cost to flavor. Other curry options the restaurant typically offers include chicken tikka masala, chana masala, lamb korma and fun Western varieties catering to the locale î such as shrimp tikka masala.† Paneer tikka masala and chili garlic naan from Naan Stop. Carolyn Li / Daily Nexus As a vegetarian, I never once felt alienated throughout my visit. Naan Stop caters to all diets in full: vegetarians, non-vegetarians, and vegans alike can find ease in ordering here. Even various spice levels can be managed. What I missed from back home the most were my green chilis and hot sauce. Here, the bread options ranged from the classic naan bread, aloo paratha and roti, to cheese naan, garlic naan and the ultimate combo that I ended up choosing: chili garlic naan. The kick was undeniable. Furthermore, while the menu items don't clearly indicate if there are nuts or common allergens in the dishes, asking the staff can satisfy any questions on that matter. I left a little less homesick that night, the rich paneer, soft, pillowy naan and thick mango lassi a memory on my lips that I knew would lure me back every weekend î all at a cost under $20. If you're looking for relatively affordable and aromatic Indian curries with multicultural deviations to surprise, make Naan Stop your next stop.† Meanwhile, here's a recipe for the traditional version of mango lassi, a simple, refreshing lassi that you can easily make on your own!

Are you bored of bland breakfast staples like pancakes and cereal? Are you constantly telling your housemates you want to try cooking new things? Even if you answered noù to all of these questions, I'm still going to tout this shakshuka recipe because I promise it will raise your quality of life after just one bite. Originally North African, yet often claimed as Israeli due to mid-20th-century migration, shakshuka is a dish with poached eggs in a sweet and tangy tomato sauce. In recent years, social media has begun popularizing shakshuka in Western countries, too. While not many restaurants nearby serve this unique dish, shakshuka is made with kitchen staples and takes less than 30 minutes to whip up, meaning cooks of any skill level are guaranteed to succeed. I first tried making shakshuka based on the popularized New York Times recipe, but I have gradually tweaked it to fit my preference: my version is individually sized, is more heavily spiced and features spinach. Though I prefer serving it for breakfast, this vegetarian dish can also be eaten for lunch or dinner.†† Ingredients: † Directions: My personal favorite pairing is shakshuka and sourdough bread, but in a pinch, wheat or white bread î or even a bagel î can act as the perfect vessel.

on-the-menu,Medium Raw:ù A Memoir by Anthony Bourdain,10-Nov-22,1:05 PM,['Max Yim'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-10/medium-raw-a-memoir-by-anthony-bourdain/,"McKensie Buchman | Daily Nexus Published in 2010, Medium Rawù accounts the late Anthony Bourdain's journeys in a series of confessions, criticisms and interviews of some of the most contentious figures in the culinary world. Medium Rawù gives the reader an insightful and mature perspective of the industry while still maintaining the brutal honesty and vividity that makes his writing so engaging. Medium Rawù opens with a secret dinner party of the top culinary minds akin to a James Bond movie where they consume the highly-illegal ortolan, an outlawed French songbird delicacy, showcasing Bourdain's candor and dedication to the truth, which runs through the entire novel. Few culinary authors would have the audacity to willingly expose the secrets and idiosyncrasies that make the restaurant industry what it is; Bourdain enlightens the reader with rich travels, blood-sucking journalists, bad meat and so much more, all without sugarcoating. His love and respect for the industry are apparent throughout the novel, but his brutal honesty prevents romanticizing it at the same time. For example, in the chapter So You Wanna Be a Chef,ù Bourdain informs readers about what it actually takes to be a chef and the physical and mental tolls that chefs undergo daily, crushing many dreams in the process. Bourdain isn't actively deterring anyone from being a chef î he's just being realistic and honest. And while some readers may dislike his strong voice, I find it refreshing to read.† One of my favorite quotes is his explanation of the Grandma rule,ù in which he explains, You may not like Grandma's Thanksgiving turkey. It may be overcooked and dry î and her stuffing salty and studded with rubbery pellets of giblet you find unpalatable in the extreme. You may not even like turkey at all. But it's Grandma's turkey. And you are in Grandma's house. So shut the fuck up and eat it.ù Bourdain knows how to entertain with his writing, and within Medium Raw,ù there is rarely a dull moment. The hallmark of Medium Raw,ù in my opinion, is its ability to immerse the reader in Bourdain's escapades. While reading, I found myself in Bourdain's shoes: interviewing David Chang, eating oysters and pearls at The French Laundry or slurping down pho on the streets of Hanoi; this is the power of his descriptive writing. On multiple occasions, I got up and grabbed something to eat because reading of the yakitori in Shinjuku, the pastrami on Houston street and the pain aux raisins of Paris all made me insatiably hungry. One of the best chapters I've ever read was literally about cutting fish î to be fair, it was at a Michelin Star restaurant î but I digress; he wrote 20 pages about someone cutting fish, and I never lost a bit of interest. The supposedly mundane task of fileting fish is transformed into a detailed account of someone's livelihood and the various specifications and mannerisms that are undertaken. Bourdain takes nonfiction, a genre typically not known for its expressive capabilities (trust me, I'm a history major), and paints a vivid, riveting picture of the culinary world that never fails to capture your attention. If you have any interest in the culinary arts, whether you're a full-on foodie or just getting started, I strongly recommend this book to you. Bourdain's writing is for everyone and, sure, it may help to know a little French, but that won't stop you from enjoying Medium Raw.ù If you decide to pick up Medium Raw,ù I hope and trust that you will be as deeply enthralled in Bourdain's adventures as I was.

on-the-menu,How mashed potatoes became a smash hit: A brief history,17-Nov-22,10:18 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-17/how-mashed-potatoes-became-a-smash-hit-a-brief-history/,"Every table spread for the holidays consists of staple dishes that we simply cannot do without. Christmas without gingerbread houses? Thanksgiving without turkey? Impossible. While these star dishes take the stage, there is one powerful behind-the-scenes player at hand, a resilient dish that has stood the test of time. For what it may often lack in visual attraction, it makes up for with its creamy, melt-in-the-mouth texture, its subtle nuttiness and its soothing, warm aroma. But just how did mashed potatoes become such a keystone species in the holiday ecosystem? Courtesy of Flickr Tracing back the key ingredient in mashed potatoes (take a guess at what that might be), we find ourselves in the icy Andes Mountains in Chile around 10,000 years ago. The nutritional value and robustness of the potato, able to withstand such harsh conditions, forced it as a staple into the South American diet, keeping the mountain dwelling communities stable while European nations, such as the Irish, crumbled under famine. However, the potato was not always edible. It started off as a small, bitter vegetable with toxins that made it hazardous to consume. By the time the Spanish arrived and conquered the Andeans in the mid-14th century, it had transformed into a more pleasant, totally edible vegetable, thanks to the selective breeding tactics of the Andes people.† From there, it was a fast track to fame for the potato. The Spanish had recognized its nutritional value and brought it to Europe, and though at first it was shunned (even outlawed in France from 1748-72), considered food for livestock and not fit for human consumption, its belly-filling, energizing qualities were undeniable and soon made it a smash hit. Everyone wanted their hands on the potato gold: the French, the English and, yes, the Irish. Now the potato is the third-most-consumed food source in the world, and people can't seem to get enough of it. But who mashed it first? The Andes people were thought to mash their potatoes and eat them, but the earliest verified appearance of mashed potatoes in history is in the 18th century from English author Hanna Glasse's cookbook, The Art of Cookery.ù The simple wording of the recipe, once overly complicated and restricted to aristocracy, made it accessible to the common man and allowed for it to spread as far as it has today. Today, there are seemingly infinite varieties of the versatile mashed potato. Its simple base flavors allow it to mesh well with a plethora of ingredients, as seen with the Irish variety of mashed potato, the traditional Irish colcannon. It is the adaptability of the mashed potato, its warm disposition, that allowed it to sneak its way onto millions of dining tables every holiday season, and into our hearts as well.† The best thing about mashed potatoes is how personal they can be. You can make just about any modification to them, as long as they involve soft and creamy potatoes. This holiday season, try something new with your mashed potatoes. Add some new ingredients and make the recipe your own! Happy holidays! A version of this article appeared on p. 14 of the November 17, 2022 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,So you got invited to friendsgiving¶,17-Nov-22,10:27 AM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-17/so-you-got-invited-to-friendsgiving/,"A Friendsgiving spread complete with stuffed squash, roasted vegetables, tomato soup and other seasonal dishes. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus So. You got invited to a potluck or, to be seasonally specific, to a Friendsgiving. Great! Only one issue: You don't know how to cook. That's fine, every Friendsgiving needs someone to bring the sparkling cider, the wine or the plates. But, what if you're done being the drink-bringer? The perpetual provider of paper plates and plastic spoons? What if you want to take your first steps into the culinary world? I'm here to help, with a couple of easy-to-make ideas to get you in and out of the kitchen without fuss, and with a delicious meal for your friends.† Seasonal salad Do you know how to put things into a bowl? Great! That means you're capable of making a delicious salad. It might not sound like the most exciting contribution, but I think it's certainly one of the most necessary. During a meal laden with heavy gravy, creamy mashed potatoes and starchy yams, something crisp, fresh and green can be a much-needed breath of fresh air. Seasonal, autumnal ingredients make for some of the best salads: apples, pears, cranberries (fresh or dried), kale, swiss chard ¶ the potential for deliciousness is endless. Just cut everything up into slices or bite-sized pieces and toss them in a bowl with some dressing. You don't even have to make the dressing! You can buy any number of delicious salad dressings from your grocery store. Who's going to know? Nobody. Me? Don't worry, I'm great at keeping secrets.† Charcuterie board Making a charcuterie board is also extremely easy. Plus, for whatever reason, they seem to carry a lot of clout; everyone loves posting a charcuterie board on their Instagram story. It's as simple as buying some crackers, fruit, cheese and cured meat, and arranging them nicely on a cutting board or plate. It's a perfect appetizer for pre-dinner grazing and will surely be appreciated at your Friendsgiving.† Baked sweet potatoes I'll never understand why the Tribe of Thanksgiving Elders decided the best way to prepare sweet potatoes was to bury them in marshmallows. It's an affront to the delicious sweetness already held within the humble sweet potato. Sweet potatoes need very little to become a stunning side dish. Set your oven to 425 F, poke holes all over the sweet potatoes with a fork and put them in the oven for 40-50 minutes. That's it. Test their doneness by stabbing them with a knife: if it cuts through easily, it's ready. The deliciousness-to-difficulty ratio is through the roof here. These sweet potatoes are beautifully fluffy, sweet and satisfying. Cut them open, throw a pad of butter and some salt inside and you've got a delicious side dish.† I understand the fear surrounding potlucks. Despite cooking for years, despite being the editor of this section, I still get nervous when I'm feeding my friends and my family. It's scary to cook for people! However, it's also a great way to show your friends you love them. I find so much fulfillment in feeding those I love, and I'm sure you will too. These three ideas are perfect if you're looking to get into cooking this holiday season; they're delicious and easy ¶ what's not to love?

on-the-menu,Persimmon and plum crumble: a foolproof fall dessert,17-Nov-22,10:37 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-17/persimmon-and-plum-crumble-a-foolproof-fall-dessert/,"On a Sunday afternoon after my weekly farmers market trip, I found myself with two pounds of seasonal stone fruits and no idea how to consume it all. The supplier of this fruit bounty was the Burkdoll Farm stand at the Goleta farmers market. Their farm is located in Visalia, California, and has been proudly family-owned since 1858. At their stand, you'll find tens of red buckets filled with seasonal fruit; in the fall, expect to find grape varieties, massive pomegranates and at least three varieties of plums and specialty fruit like pineapple guava. Shoppers can mix and match fruit, paying by total weight at the end of the line where homemade jams are also sold.† Stand out at the Thanksgiving dessert table with this melt-in-your-mouth fall treat. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus While I'm sometimes on dessert duty for Thanksgiving, I must confess, I've never made a pie from scratch. There's so much at stake when making a pie: a crust that's not too thin yet still buttery and flakey, a perfect ratio of fruit filling, the pressure to create beautiful latticework and much more. Maybe I'm being overdramatic, but opting for fruit crumble rather than pie takes a lot of the pressure off whoever's baking. Even if it's assembled messily, this persimmon and plum crumble is a very forgiving dessert and still produces excellent flavors no matter what the end result looks like.† Ingredients: For the fruit filling: For the crumb topping: Directions: Persimmon is an unconventional choice of fruit to base a dessert around, but what's wrong with a little experimentation? Every family has its own holiday traditions and signature dishes that make an appearance at celebrations, and I'm hoping to make this dessert into a recurring tradition for my family. Perhaps this fruit crumble will be so good it will successfully sidetrack the uncomfortable conversations unfurling at the table î but then again, this is just a recipe, and I don't want to make any false promises.

on-the-menu,Salmon Wellington: A terrific turkey alternative,24-Nov-22,8:47 AM,['Joey Sable'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-24/salmon-wellington-a-terrific-turkey-alternative/,"I am, of the belief, presuming many of you are in congruence with the fact that the traditional roast turkey bird is abhorrently the worst part of the whole Thanksgiving feast. While I will always place one piece of dark meat and one piece of white meat on my initial plate of food, the turkey solely serves as the base for the accretion of side dishes and tastes that are truly the vehicle for a satisfying and hearty Thanksgiving meal. I only find turkey digestible when I incorporate cranberry sauce, gravy, mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts into a single uniform bite. I find it dry and tough î bluntly, it sucks. How did turkey become a Thanksgiving staple over other tastier birds like duck or chicken? That being said, I sought to make a Thanksgiving main dish that incorporates complex flavors and is everything turkey is not: something with moistness and rich flavor that still feels ceremonious and special without needing to tend to it for hours upon end. Fish is delicate and rich, a strong pescatarian alternate to the bird. When treated en cro√ªte with layers of vegetables and cream, it is amplified to a main holiday dish worthy of being at the center of the table. Easy to make in three steps and delectable to eat, give my Salmon Wellington recipe a try this Thanksgiving or holiday season!† Layers of puff pastry, spinach, mushrooms and salmon constitute this meatless Thanksgiving main dish. Joey Sable / Daily Nexus *Cooking Tip*† Seasoning with salt is crucial in every step! You'd rather have an over-salted wellington than an underwhelming, under-flavored wellington. Salt and sodium can always be diluted by other measures while the lack of salt during crucial moments of cooking cannot be compensated in any way. That being said, I usually eyeball measurements for salt and pepper and did the same for this recipe. If you're making this recipe, I assume you know how to season food properly.† Ingredients: Directions: 1) Preheat the oven to 425 F.† 2) First, make the creamed spinach. Chop the onion and mince the garlic cloves. Place 2 tablespoons of the butter into a small pot on medium heat and add the onion and garlic. Adding salt, cook the onion and garlic until fragrant and translucent. Add the spinach and cook until wilted. Once wilted, remove the pot from the heat and add in the cream cheese and parmesan. Season and adjust with salt and pepper.† 3) Then, make the mushroom duxelles. Finely chop the white and crimini mushrooms. Using a cheesecloth or any sort of cloth available to you, drain the moisture out of the finely chopped mushrooms. After draining the mushrooms, finely mince the shallots. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small pan and add the mushrooms and shallots as well as salt and pepper. Cook for around 5 minutes until all moisture has evaporated from the mixture. Add another tablespoon of butter to the pan as well as the white wine, cooking until all the liquid has evaporated again. Adjust with salt and pepper.† 4) Assemble the layers of the wellington. On a cutting board, season the salmon filet with salt, pepper and lemon on both sides. Place and spread the puff pastry onto another cutting board. Spread the mushroom duxelles on the horizontal center of the puff pastry from top to bottom, leaving the edges of the puff pastry bare. Place the fish on the bed of duxelles, then layer the top of the salmon with the creamed spinach mixture. Take the puff pastry edges and lift them up to cover the top. Since the edges of the puff pastry keep some of the mixture exposed, take another sheet of puff pastry and layer it over the top of the exposed puff pastry. Make sure the puff pastry is covered so it doesn't leave any exposure to the filling.† 5) Prep the wellington for the egg wash, scoring and baking. Cover the sheet tray with parchment paper. Place the puff pastry creation onto the sheet tray and brush the top and sides with egg wash. Score the puff pastry diagonally and apply another layer of egg wash. Bake the salmon wellington in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.† If you make this for your family, the potential nostalgia or craving for turkey will not even be an afterthought.

on-the-menu,A Hainanese Chicken Friendsgiving,2-Dec-22,4:21 PM,['Max Yim'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-12-02/a-hainanese-chicken-friendsgiving/,"Max Yim | Daily Nexus This November, I decided to host a Friendsgiving, which I've never done before. For my offering, I initially decided upon cooking a Peking duck, but I accidentally bought a chicken without realizing it (I don't know how I made that mistake either). So, instead of a Peking duck, I chose to cook a Hainanese chicken, a dish originating from the island of Hainan off the southern coast of China. The dish itself is a poached chicken, served with rice seasoned with the fat of the chicken alongside a variety of sauces, such as garlic soy sauce and chili sauce. I used Adam Liaw's recipe as a guideline for the chicken rice. I started with preparing the chicken (which my roommates and I affectionately named Daffyù before learning that it was chicken), and this entailed trimming the fat near the butt of the chicken and massaging the rest of the bird with a generous amount of salt. I then cut up some green onions and ginger and added that to a pot, along with the water I was going to poach the chicken in and brought that to a boil. The fragrance of the broth was heavenly and the scent of ginger filled the room. I put the chicken in the broth and brought the heat down to a simmer so as to not toughen the chicken. I constantly monitored the temperature of the bird with a probe thermometer; I needed this chicken to be at the very least edible, and preferably on the pleasant side, but anyone who's tasted overcooked chicken will know that it can have the texture of chalk. After about 30 minutes in the water, the chicken was done. I placed it in an ice bath to cool and shock the skin, and let it rest for a while until it was time to carve. While the chicken was cooling, I prepared my roasted potatoes as a side while my roommates were making their own dishes: my roommate Kyle made guacamole and a tofu stir-fry, and my roommate Kole made a chicken salad. The kitchen was chaotic, but it was really nice to have us all cooking in the same kitchen together. We didn't really collaborate as we were all cooking our own separate dishes, but they provided invaluable company, and I was grateful for their contributions. Dinner was soon ready, and we were all seated, anxiously awaiting our meal. The food was delicious; everyone's dishes came out fantastic. I was nervous about how the chicken would come out since this was my first time making Hainanese chicken but, to our delight, the chicken was quite tender, and I served it with a dipping garlic soy sauce which added a sweet and salty depth. This is probably not a common problem, but if you ever need to use a whole chicken, you can't go wrong with cooking it Hainanese style. The meal wasn't really about the chicken, though î I know this is excessively cheesy and I'm laying it on thick, but having a sit-down dinner with my close friends nearing the end of the quarter was really heartwarming. We sat and talked and laughed and just had a lovely time. Food and cooking are wonderful in their power to bring people together and are truly invaluable for creating cherished memories.

on-the-menu,Spread holiday cheer with this nonalcoholic cranberry pomegranate spritz,10-Dec-22,2:25 PM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-12-10/spread-holiday-cheer-with-this-nonalcoholic-cranberry-pomegranate-spritz/,"A touch of rosemary and the addition of infused simple syrup elevate this mocktail for the holiday season. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Ah, the holidays. Don't you just love them? The joy of seeing the places you routinely visit decorated with plastic pine garlands and shiny, red ornaments. Gingerbread and eggnog everything. Unbearable Christmas music that blares through every store from Thanksgiving until New Year's. After reflecting, I wouldn't describe the holidays as a totally joyous time but rather a season ripe with anxieties and stress.† Thus, it's not surprising that many drown these stressors in alcohol during the holidays. Over the past few months, I've been evaluating my own relationship with alcohol and the times I use it. I've found that alcohol can make a gathering more fun, yet it is unnecessary if you're around the right people that can bring a good time just through their presence. Additionally, alcohol can also have adverse effects like irritability, stomach issues and saying things you might regret the next morning.† I know Martinelli's has become the go-to alcohol-free celebratory beverage, but I find it a little too boring, especially given all the other nonalcoholic drink options you can find in stores these days. This alcohol-free cranberry pomegranate spritz feels sophisticated and festive with the addition of homemade simple syrup and fancy garnishes that are bound to get you in the holiday mood.† Ingredients (makes 2 drinks): For the simple syrup: For the sugared cranberries: Directions:† This mocktail takes a little longer to make than most mixed drinks but making it was also a way to force myself to slow down during the hectic holiday season. Peeling away the layers of pomegranate to extract the tiny seeds is a painstaking process that I found oddly therapeutic. Slowly stirring the simple syrup until it dissolved meant I had to focus on the task at hand so I wouldn't burn the pot of sugar, but it also meant that I couldn't use that time to doomscroll on Instagram or become jealous of everyone's seemingly extravagant travel plans. I hope that making this drink isn't only enjoyable for its sweet and tart flavors, but that the process can also give you a glimmer of relaxation amidst holiday chaos.†

on-the-menu,Potato Kugel: Not your typical casserole,19-Jan-23,12:45 PM,['Joey Sable'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-19/potato-kugel-not-your-typical-casserole/,"Kugel is a baked casserole-like dish of the Ashkenazi tradition. Eddie Zhao / Daily Nexus I was born into a family of Orthodox Jews, my ancestry consisting of Torah scholars, rabbis and community leaders. Beginning with my òbrit milah' at eight days old, I became part of a community rich in tradition and history. Dating back to the shtetls of Byelorussia, now known as Belarus, in the late 19th century, my forefathers escaped the pogroms with minimal possessions and boarded a steamship to a place where their religion could be practiced without persecution. They set a precedent for cherishing family and community while valuing both secular and religious learning, history and tradition. The intersection of my religious Jewish upbringing with my unapologetic queerness encourages me to take the familial traditions passed down to me via generations and queer them. Despite the systemic exclusivity of queerness in Orthodox Jewish spaces, I genuinely love certain aspects of my upbringing and love to transmit these respective values and tenets to non-Jews, to queer people and to queer Jews especially. As I continue to explore my place within the Orthodox and broader Jewish community, my innate queerness lends me the opportunity to hybridize these traditions and foment new traditions of my own.†† From challah to latkes, brisket and tzimmes, Jewish food is broad and encompassing. I have tasked myself to accomplish and perfect a list of Jewish foods and recipes. Every Jewish mother or grandmother has their own special recipes for meals and food universally shared in the broader Jewish world. I wanted to create a recipe that evoked memories of growing up standing next to my Savta ì grandmother ì in the kitchen, observing her labor over Shabbat and holiday meals with such meticulous care. Every recipe my Savta makes is so decadent and rich, and I knew I wanted to recreate my favorite recipe of her's: Potato Kugel. Kugel is a baked casserole-like dish of the Ashkenazi tradition. Highly ambiguous, kugel can be sweet or savory, with a potato or noodle base. Technically, potato kugel can be grated or blended; my Savta's recipe uses blended potatoes while I prefer a more textured kugel. It is practically a latke recipe but baked in a dish, creating a crisp exterior with a smooth and creamy interior texture. Sorry for the expletive, but it is so fucking good.† Ingredients: Directions: By the way, kugel is pronounced kuh-gulù and not koo-gulù but some will tell you otherwise. Don't listen to them.

While I'm very anti-New Year's resolutions (I refuse to set unrealistic expectations for myself and beat myself up for not accomplishing them), I did start the new year with one goal in mind: to branch out from my go-to eateries in Isla Vista and try new restaurants in Goleta and Santa Barbara. During the past few months, I also reincorporated animal products back into my diet after being vegan-ish for two years, and was eager to step foot into restaurants at which I would have never dined when I only ate plants. I present to you a list of the best things I ate in Santa Barbara County during the past year.† Tteokbokki at Secret Bao A table of noodle dishes, bao buns and more from Secret Bao. Celine Pun / Daily Nexus Celine Pun's review of this restaurant was the only thing I needed to read in order to convince myself to dine at Secret Bao. I scored a highly sought-after reservation and enjoyed a variety of their signature bao buns and my first introduction to tteokbokki, a Korean dish involving soft and chewy rice cakes paired with delicata squash, bok choy and other vegetables tossed in a slightly sweet sauce with notes of sesame. Secret Bao's inventive flavor combinations made the meal so worthwhile.† Salads and wraps at The Blue Owl Fried Rice and Salmon Salads from The Blue Owl. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus If I'm looking for a place downtown to grab lunch, without a doubt, I'm going to The Blue Owl. It's the perfect place to eat with family when they're in town î a sit-down restaurant that has more of an ambiance compared to a casual sandwich shop such as Sam's To Go, but also not exorbitantly overpriced. Their lunch menu includes a selection of sandwiches, wraps, salads and fried rice combinations. I appreciate how vegan- and gluten-free-friendly their menu is, especially when I was tasked to find a restaurant that accommodated my meat-free preferences and my dad's gluten sensitivity during his visit to Santa Barbara last spring. We ordered the vegan and gluten-free Fried Rice Salad and Smoked Salmon Salad and left very satisfied. Their pastry case is often stocked with delicious baked goods from Santa Barbara-based bakery Good Stuff Baked Treats.† Thai takeout from Your Choice Restaurant My award for best Thai food in the area goes to Your Choice Restaurant in the upper area of State Street. I'm not sure if I can count on my fingers the number of times I have ordered their garlicky Pad See Yew and Crab Rangoon during fall quarter, but it hit the spot everytime. This family-owned restaurant has weekly specials and pop-ups including Creaminal's No Sad Sundaes, an ice cream social featuring Your Choice owner Piti Sukavivatanachai's homemade ice cream every Saturday night, and regular donut events with KIN BAKESHOP. It's always special to see community partnerships like these flourish. Squash Blossom Quesadillas and Picadillo Empanadas at Mesa Verde Restaurant Picadillo Empanadas and housemade sparkling lemonade from Mesa Verde. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Take a scenic drive over to West Mesa to indulge in Mexican- and Mediterranean-inspired vegan fare at Mesa Verde Restaurant. This year was not the first time I had dined at Mesa Verde Restaurant; in fact, it has been one of my favorite restaurants in the area for years (even as someone who recently ditched veganism). Their menu changes somewhat seasonally, drawing me back to the restaurant to try their newest offerings. The one thing they always get right is their housemade vegan dairy alternatives, evident in the cashew cream in their Squash Blossom Quesadillas and the jackfruit and butternut nacho cheese filling in their Picadillo Empanadas. So many deli items from the Isla Vista Food Co-op If you're a UC Santa Barbara student who has never stepped foot in the I.V. Food Co-op, let this be your sign to do so! The community-owned grocery store makes several items in-house, including dips and spreads, seasonal salads, chia pudding, baked goods and my go-to item: The F#$@%*! Best Wrap Ever (yes, this is its actual title and it lives up to its name). The wrap has tempeh, hummus, tomato, vegan cream cheese and arugula, and essentially tastes like a vegan BLT. On days when I can't seem to find the time or energy to make lunch in between classes, I'm running to the Co-op to snag one of these wraps before they sell out for the day.† The pandemic drastically changed Santa Barbara's restaurant scene, meaning there are many new establishments set to open in 2023, especially on State Street. I'm personally looking forward to discovering, and writing about, more restaurants that are soon to become favorites of mine this year!

on-the-menu,(Olive Garden copycat) Chicken gnocchi soup: The ultimate rainy day recipe,26-Jan-23,8:11 PM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-26/olive-garden-copycat-chicken-gnocchi-soup-the-ultimate-rainy-day-recipe/,"Abigail Monti | Daily Nexus At this point, Olive Garden copycatsù is a whole recipe genre. Pretty much every cooking blog out there promises they've unlocked the secrets to the Italian food chain's various recipes. From Olive Garden's breadsticks, to their eggplant parmesan to their chicken alfredo, there are dozens of copycat recipes available online. I'll admit, I'm guilty of following them now and again. But there's a reason you're looking up the recipe instead of actually driving to Olive Garden: because it gives you a chance to take a tried-and-true recipe and put your own twist on it. Olive Garden's Chicken & Gnocchi Soup is the perfect canvas.† When I first found out that gnocchi soup existed, I was extremely suspicious. I'd only ever tried gnocchi with pesto or marinara sauce î who thought it would be a good idea to let the little potato balls float in broth? Well, whoever invented it was a genius. I was hooked on Olive Garden's Chicken & Gnocchi Soup the second I tried it. It's homey, warm and full of filling ingredients î because, let's be honest, there's nothing worse than slurping down a whole can of chicken noodle soup, still being hungry and viciously needing to pee.† Most Chicken & Gnocchi Soup copycat recipes, such as my inspiration by Creme De La Crumb, stay strictly true to the Olive Garden original. Yet, determined to make the ultimate rendition of the familiar favorite, I took a few liberties. To create a creamier base, I swapped half-and-half for heavy cream and added a handful of shredded parmesan cheese. To give it some smoke, I added chopped bacon and a dash of paprika. Oh, and I got rid of the celery. If you actually think celery is a worthwhile soup ingredient, you're lying. Or you were simply indoctrinated by your grandmother early on. Either way, trust me, you're better off without it. Yield: 6 servings Time: 40 minutes Ingredients: Directions: Made in one pot in under an hour, this recipe takes less time than driving to the nearest Olive Garden in Oxnard. Plus, it's the perfect meal for a rainy day. And if the rest of winter quarter resembles anything like its first few weeks, you'll have plenty of poor weather to justify giving chicken gnocchi soup a chance.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the January 26, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.†

Whatever your case may be, I've taken the liberty of rounding up a few of my current favorite chefs (in no particular order) for you to watch on the app.† @wishbonekitchen† ì 1.3M followers Meredith Hayden is quickly rising to fame. The New York-based recipe developer and professional chef initially had a start in the fashion industry and then switched to culinary arts. After studying at the Institute of Culinary Education, Hayden worked as a line cook at SoHo's Charlie Bird before eventually starting her own catering business and brand, Wishbone Kitchen.† Hayden has a slight obsession with diet soda, and I have a slight obsession with her summer vlogs depicting a day in her life as a private chef in the Hamptons. The 27-year-old chef documents her crazy long hours cooking up meals and narrates the vlogs with fun anecdotes from the weekend.†††† Hayden preaches eating whole foods and focuses her recipes on fresh vegetables while treating meat as a luxury. Her self-published cookbook, Wishbone Cookbook Vol. 2,ù features a gorgeous heirloom tomato galette on the cover and plenty of other summer recipes inside. In the warmer months, she serves up refreshing dishes like trout lox tartines or bibb salad with lobster and avocado. Don't be fooled by her bright, summer persona though; Hayden also makes a mean red wine braised beef short rib, and the first volume of her cookbook duology is inspired by holiday recipes and other winter treats.† Recently, the TikTok star has been featured in British Vogue. Hayden herself is an ex-Vogue employee, and her TikTok video commemorating the achievement shows a screenshot of the article as well as an old photo of her desk.† The young chef has been dubbed a Walmart Martha Stewart,ù and she herself has even incorporated the joke into one of her Instagram captions: martha may stewart reporting for duty #dayinmylife #privatechef.ù @lahbco ì 534.7K followers It makes sense why Nasim Lahbichi, a freshly graduated interior design student during the pandemic, would amass such a following on social media platforms. He, after all, preaches a passion for visual storytelling, and what better way than through content creation on TikTok? Now, almost three years after his start on the app, Lahbichi shares recipes each week with his 534,700 followers.† Lahbichi infuses into his recipes various Moroccan- and Puerto Rican-inspired flavor profiles† î a nod to his heritage. Some are comfort foods, like harira, a Moroccan tomato lentil soup his grandmother used to make. Lahbichi admits his take on these sorts of dishes may not be wholly traditional, but he finds them comforting nonetheless, eating harira every day for dinner in his soup era.ù Lahbichi also shares recipes that are scrumptious meal[s] you can hyperfixate on for a month,ù like green shakshuka, which as the name suggests, is full of healthy greens. His version has leeks and kale.† Along the same vein, his newest TikTok series involves sneaking vegetables into more meals. Recently, Lahbichi has discussed both farmers markets and accessibility of produce. While he incorporates fresh ingredients, such as parsnips or artichokes, Lahbichi also acknowledges the difficulties of accessing fresh produce and recognizes the convenience of canned and frozen vegetables. While on the hunt for artichokes, Lahbichi concedes, jarred is easier ¶ and we love efficiency.ù† Unlike hidden veggies, Lahbichi is quite transparent about his compensation as a content creator, so that way brands can't take as much advantage of other creators.ù Once he found a way to make a living with this line of work, it removed the stress he had with job hunting postgraduation. As he navigates the industry, Lahbichi openly shares the frustrations and joys of working to curate and create spaces for queer people of color, by queer people of color.ù At the end of the day, whether Lahbichi explains how to make a matchatini (think espresso martini but matcha) or Greek bougatsa for Pisces season, he cultivates a safe space for a compassionate, cooking community.† @thekoreanvegan ì 3M followers Joanne Lee Molinaro† first went viral for her video on Korean braised potatoes. The Chicago-based lawyer had started her blog, The Korean Vegan, years earlier when she switched to a plant-based diet and then joined the TikTok platform under the same handle in July 2020. Her content mainly revolved around politics and her life as a lawyer during quarantine, then included cooking after going viral.† Molinaro does voice-overs on her videos, and they are every bit optimistic as they are poignant. As she shares her struggles, Molinaro finds a way to share a heartfelt message to her followers. Sometimes it's about her failing relationships, and sometimes it's about individuals who are not Korean replacing gochugaru with paprika when making kimchi: It's a bit too easy for them to sacrifice other people's stories because what do they have to lose?ù† Whether substitution of ingredients can be infuriating for some, it can also mean better accessibility for another, especially when creating plant-based recipes. On the flip side, Molinaro translates this idea into her work as well: I veganize Korean food. I Koreanize everything else.ù She welcomes fusion into her kitchen, walking the line between telling her past and leaving room for the future, and she balances it beautifully.† The rise of social platforms devoted to food has made an integral change in how we consume media related to cooking. Waves of people rushed to their own kitchens, hoping to jump on new trends of making Dalgona whipped coffee, baking sourdough bread or even tackling a spicy vodka rigatoni recipe. The latter was popularly attributed to a certain famous supermodel or a certain famous Italian restaurant in New York City i.e. Gigi Hadid and Carbone. (Molinaro does a vegan version of spicy vodka sauce on her page, BTW.) Whether or not viewers at home actually follow through, though, doesn't matter î some are perfectly content with leaving it up to the experts.†

on-the-menu,Kuy Teav: A Cambodian noodle soup that will warm your heart,2-Feb-23,9:00 AM,['Max Yim'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-02/kuy-teav-a-cambodian-noodle-soup-that-will-warm-your-heart/,"Esm√© Puzio / Daily Nexus There's a scene in the movie Ratatouilleù that's a core memory to me, and anyone who's seen it can probably relate. It's the scene where Anton Ego, the food critic, takes his first bite of ratatouille, and in an instant is taken back to his childhood in the countryside, teary-eyed with a warm bowl of the very same dish served by his dear mother. The scene conveys how food can capture certain pockets of nostalgia and take you back to a simpler, warmer time. I think everyone has a dish close to their heart like Anton's ratatouille, and for me, that dish is kuy teav (pronounced ki-tyoo), a Khmer, or Cambodian, noodle soup resembling Vietnamese pho, but distinct enough to be called a separate dish. I have deeply fond memories of kuy teav. On the days my Yiey (Khmer for grandmaù) would occasionally make it, I would easily down three to four bowls of the stuff, gorging myself with countless strings of rice noodles and broth. I remember that smell î that damn smell î permeating my Yiey's house and my nostrils with that deeply intoxicating aroma I hold deep in my heart. God, I miss that smell. In my anticipation, I would dawdle around the kitchen excitedly while Yiey made my bowl. When it came time to eat, I unashamedly slurped down every last noodle, and then asked for seconds, then thirds, and on a really, really hungry day î fourths. If I didn't make it clear enough: I fucking adore kuy teav, and other than maybe my dog or my family (and that's a strong maybe), it's the thing I miss the most from home. I can try to fill that hole in my heart with pho î and don't get me wrong, I love a good bowl of pho î but for me, it just doesn't hit the same way. The general lack of anything Khmer outside of Long Beach, where I'm from, just makes me miss home more. So, I decided to try and replicate that feeling of home and fill that hole in my heart by making my own kuy teav. The following recipe is my recreation of my favorite food. Yields 12 servings. 4 hour cooking time Ingredients: Directions: This easy recipe is perfect for the cold winter days we've been having lately. Most of the time spent is downtime waiting for your broth to develop flavor, and you're rewarded with a delicious noodle soup. I'm really proud of this recipe and I hope you enjoy this piece of Khmer culture. Comments are closed.

Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus With Valentine's Day approaching, your first instinct might be to scope out a reservation for a romantic sushi dinner at OKU or wine and dine your date at a pretentious steakhouse. Let's be realistic here, Santa Barbara menu prices have been out of control lately, even if you and your Valentine end up splitting the bill. Might I offer up another suggestion: Treating your Valentine to a meal made with love for only about $10! I discovered last year that Woodstock's Pizza will sell you plain pizza dough in any size, either prerolled or in a ball, for just $2. This discovery truly changed my life. With a little help from your local pizza place, a few ingredients that can be found at any grocery store and approximately five minutes of prep time, you can create an adorable, heart-shaped pizza to enjoy with a date or share with your Galentines.† Yield: 1 medium pizza (approximately 4 slices) Time: 20 minutes† Ingredients: Directions: Since you're hosting this Valentine's Day dinner at home, presentation is everything. Pair your pizza with a drink of choice. You can never go wrong with the classic pizza and beer, or pizza and wine combination, although I'll use the holiday as an excuse to pair mine with a case of pink Grapefruit Hibiscus Boochcraft. Light a few candles, put some flowers on the table and have a wonderful, wallet-friendly, yet still-classy evening.† Comments are closed.

on-the-menu,Plan your week with easy sheet-pan combinations,12-Feb-23,10:05 PM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-12/plan-your-week-with-easy-sheet-pan-combinations/,"Abigail Monti | Daily Nexus Making a sheet-pan meal is like reading one of those choose-your-own-adventure books from the '80s, except the adventure is made of whatever neglected ingredients are in the back of your fridge and the ending is dinner. With this single formula, you can combine a random variety of ingredients that may have otherwise gone bad and turn it into an easy meal that will last you through the week. Here's what it takes: 1 pound of chopped (raw or precooked) protein, 3 cups of chopped non-starchy vegetables and 3 cups of chopped starchy vegetables. Throw together a quick dressing of olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic. Toss in your sheet pan and bake at 425 F for 20-30 minutes. Done.† I tend to get four meals out of each sheet pan when using these measurements. Optionally, you can cook rice or pasta on the side to make each serving more filling. I recommend packaging up servings in individual Tupperware and storing them in the fridge for easy, on-the-go meals between classes. While the possibilities for sheet pan meals are endless, here are some of my favorite combinations: While these dinner combinations have carried me through many busy school weeks, I've recently joined the foray into breakfast sheet pans. Without them, there's no way I'd make it to my 8 a.m. class on time. In addition to the formula above, most breakfast sheet pans tend to incorporate eggs as well. The eggs can be baked alongside the other ingredients in the oven or scrambled straight on the hot sheet pan once pulled out of the oven. Try these breakfast variations for a grab-and-go meal that isn't a sad granola bar: With only three main ingredients, sheet pan meals fit easily into any student's budget. Remember, these combinations are just recommendations: Feel free to prioritize cheaper ingredients or make substitutions. Personally, I like to buy whichever protein Albertsons has on sale, then coordinate the other ingredients around it. I've even found success using frozen vegetables!† If that's not enough to convince you, consider the fact that sheet pan meals only require a pan, a cutting board and a knife to make. If you buy precut ingredients, you can knock out two dishes and only have one pan to wash: A busy student's dream. Give your future self a break and try making a sheet pan meal next Monday. Trust me, Friday, you will be grateful.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the February 9, 2023 edition of the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,"Meet Sandra Adu Zelli, the British chef behind Gipsy Hill Bakery",15-Feb-23,7:06 PM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-15/meet-sandra-adu-zelli-the-british-chef-behind-gipsy-hill-bakery/,"It doesn't have to be blood, sweat and tears working in a kitchen,ù said Sandra Adu Zelli, the owner of Gipsy Hill Bakery, while reflecting on the decades she has spent working in the culinary world.† Sandra Adu Zelli at home in her kitchen. Courtesy of Jezaira Knight. Adu Zelli has done it all during her career: she completed a three-year culinary program at the Colchester Institute, worked in MICHELIN star-aspiring restaurants, created dessert menus for Santa Barbara restaurants, collaborated with fellow chefs and started her own business, all while balancing her career with motherhood. Yet, after years of working in high-pressure, fast-paced restaurant environments, the idea of working for more casual eateries and eventually starting her own business garnered more appeal.† During secondary education in England, Adu Zelli discovered her love of food in her home economics course. With this newfound interest, she enrolled in a culinary program at the Colchester Institute in Essex, where she studied from the ages of 16 to 19. On the side, she washed dishes at a family-owned restaurant in Harwich called The Ship, which, according to Yelp, unfortunately closed in 2015. Adu Zelli spent a few years at The Ship, working her way up to helping with the plating of dishes before they reached the tables of eager customers. Slowly but surely, she gained more confidence in commercial kitchens before moving to Holland for a year to complete a culinary program at the Hilton.† As a young chef, I did not want to do pastry. I was a bit of a tomboy and preferred to cook. I always thought that pastry was for girls, even though I was a girl, but I wanted to do what those guys were doing. You know, I love the excitement of a busy service and the pressure and working precisely î I really loved it,ù she said.† Once she had completed her culinary education, she moved on to working in London's fine dining scene. Working long hours and intense shifts, she would return home after work and practice baking, developing skills that she was not implementing at these high-end establishments. Years later, her focus shifted to more casual restaurants, working alongside famous chefs including Yotam Ottolenghi of Ottolenghi and continuing to delve deeper into the world of pastry.† I wasn't naturally gifted at pastry. It was a hard learning curve for me,ù she said. I persevered, I wanted to be good at it.ù† Adu Zelli and her husband planned to move to Santa Barbara in 2008 after her husband found a position as manager of room service at the Four Seasons Resort The Biltmore Santa Barbara. The pair thought they'd only stay in Santa Barbara for two years, but this year marks 15 years since their move to the area. When they first moved here, she focused on raising their first child while picking up jobs as a private chef to work around her child's schedule before forming valuable community connections that led to job opportunities. One of her passions is opening new restaurants, and with many friends active in Santa Barbara's food scene, she began to see her creative ideas for pastry menus come to fruition. In 2011, Mexican restaurant Cielito was set to open for the following year in the La Arcada Plaza downtown, and owners Gordon Hardy and Karen Phillips approached Adu Zelli to create a dessert menu. Having never cooked Mexican food, Adu Zelli took on the challenge and immersed herself in Latin American cuisine. The job offered her complete creative freedom to develop recipes and along the way, she found a way to bridge the gap between Mexican food and classic European desserts. Learning to make flan seemed less intimidating after years of practicing its French counterpart, cr√®me caramel.† Five years later, another exciting job opportunity presented itself at Handlebar Coffee Roasters. As a regular customer at Handlebar's original East Canon Perdido Street location, Adu Zelli became acquainted with owners Aaron Olson and Kim Anderson after many daily visits to the coffee shop with her daughter. Olson and Anderson approached her about a pastry chef position in the fall of 2017 during the construction of their second location on De La Vina Street. Slightly unsure about the level of commitment, she excitedly accepted the position that fulfilled her interest in facilitating restaurant openings and helping other restaurateurs with their pastry needs. Their opening in 2018 was extremely successful. Even though this was not an upscale restaurant with a high-pressure environment, the position still carried a degree of stress for someone who was balancing motherhood while working. It was time for her to take her culinary career into a different direction with more flexibility.† Gipsy Hill Bakery sells cookie boxes in flavor varieties such as Chocolate Chip. Courtesy of Sandra Adu Zelli. The name Gipsy Hill derives from Adu Zelli's hometown in London. Adu Zelli and her husband bought their first home in Crystal Palace, a town resting atop a large hill with sprawling views of London. Their train stop on the way home was called Gipsy Hill, and after working grueling hours at fast-paced restaurants, she would get off the train and trudge up the hill on her way home. The walk home was a time to reflect on the day and enjoy the reward of a beautiful view at the top. It was the place where she felt she first adulted,ù and it serves as a physical metaphor for the series of challenges and rewards she has faced while working in the food industry.† In 2018, Katie Hershfelt of Cultivate Events organized the Santa Barbara Night Market, a pop-up holiday market in the former-Macy's building in Paseo Nuevo, inviting Adu Zelli to sell her baked goods at the event. This was Gipsy Hill Bakery's debut alongside other small businesses. Adu Zelli described the six-week pop-up as exciting but chaotic,ù as she spent long nights baking pastries in Cielito's kitchen downtown after the restaurant had closed for the night. The day after Thanksgiving, Gipsy Hill Bakery sold out at the Night Market within an hour and a half. A series of local pop-ups in the following months helped this small business garner a growing customer base.† Along with many small businesses, Gipsy Hill Bakery's business slowed during 2020 when events were getting canceled left and right. A Bakers Against Racism Bake Sale in Santa Barbara inspired Adu Zelli to get back to baking in June of 2020, which was not only a way to support small-scale bakeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also a way to give back to the Black community. Participants in the national Bakers Against Racism movement, which was started by chefs in Washington, D.C. in 2020, donated their profits to a charity of their choice that supports the Black community. To participate in the bake sale, Adu Zelli made batches of brioche that customers could pick up at The Daisy downtown. The community response was extremely positive and the batch of brioche sold out in under an hour. The success of this online ordering resulted in the creation of a biweekly menu from which customers could order and do contactless pick-up throughout the pandemic. Items on the menu often include classic cookie flavors, seasonal galettes and danishes, just to name a few, all made with organic ingredients and organic produce sourced from vendors at the Santa Barbara Farmers Market.† Working for herself has been a great experience for Adu Zelli, who can now find more time in her schedule for family and other culinary endeavors. For now, Gipsy Hill Bakery's pick-up orders are on pause while she focuses on wholesale orders for restaurants in Southern California and other local collaborations, including Two Baking Brits, a business partnership with cook and food writer Pascale Beale. Together, Beale and Adu Zelli host a variety of events and pop-up dinners.† Currently, Gipsy Hill Bakery is in a period of transition with the hopes to scale up further and continue collaborating with other local restaurants in the Santa Barbara area. Customers can stay up to date on upcoming events and projects by following Gipsy Hill Bakery on Instagram.† I love the connection that food brings,ù shared Adu Zelli, and for me, that's the silver lining of all of this.ù A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the February 16, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Co-op hosts fair trade chocolate tasting,16-Feb-23,9:00 AM,['Maya Salem'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-16/i-v-co-op-hosts-fair-trade-chocolate-tasting/,"Pieces of Chocolove Strong Dark Chocolate and Endangered Species Dark Chocolate with Cacao Nibs were served alongside strawberries. Maya Salem / Daily Nexus At the end of a long week of midterms, walking home through Isla Vista can only be made better by one thing: free chocolate. The Friday afternoon haze was brought to life by a chocolate tasting event on the Isla Vista Food Co-op patio. Hundreds of tasting cups made from recyclable paper covered the table. Inside each cup, beautiful cross-sections of strawberries awaited their cacao pairings. On a cutting board, employees chopped up the colorful bars and then placed small chunks of chocolate into the cups.† Four different chocolates were served, each with verified Fair Trade packaging. Fair Trade USA, established in 1998 after coffee farmers in Nicaragua were exploited for their labor, is now an important evaluation to ensure ethical treatment of workers and products. This certification is most seen in cacao beans, coffee, bananas, honey and cotton, which historically have had some of the worst problems with unfair dealings in agricultural laborers and work conditions.† Fair trade allows small farmers better working conditions as well as protection from large corporations. By buying fair trade products, people can support farmers and give them more control over their own and their community's future. To ensure the products are fair trade, check the labels. I tasted the four chocolates in order of cocoa content, from white to dark:† Tony's Chocolonely Raspberry Popping Candy Chocolate (0% cocoa): Like all white chocolate, this is not a true chocolate, as it doesn't contain cocoa. The bar had a colorful presentation î the little raspberry seeds sprinkled throughout the creamy bar were unique and aesthetically pleasing next to the rest of the chocolate. With a strawberry, the sweetness of the white chocolate was muted, which brought forth the tangy raspberry pops. As a lover of dark chocolate, I wasn't the biggest fan of the raspberry white chocolate. However, its buttery nature, despite its coarse look and feel, was a pleasant surprise. Tony's Chocolonely Milk Chocolate (32% cocoa): The milk chocolate was initially sweeter than most milk chocolates I've had, though it maintained a warm and quite delicious richness. There was a decent amount of melting, and it had a slight salty aftertaste, which prompted me to want to pair it with caramel. The strawberry still proved a valid, complementary pairing. My only complaint was the thickness of the bar, which did not feel as balanced with the size of the strawberry.† Chocolove Strong Dark Chocolate (70% cocoa): The jump from 32% cocoa to 70% cocoa was a startling change, just on a scale of sweetness to bitterness. With a darker color and taste, this was one of my favorites of the chocolates. However, the fruity notes in this dark chocolate were a wonderful cool relief from the overwhelming rich sweetness of the first two chocolates. The aftertaste could only be described as having a umami-type complexity, complemented by its smooth surface and fine texture. The Chocolove dark chocolate had a great balance of taste and aroma overall. Endangered Species Dark Chocolate with Cacao Nibs (72% cocoa): Sprinkled with roasted cacao nibs (earthy, crushed pieces of cacao beans), this dark chocolate was rich with floral overtones. This was perfect with the strawberry pairing, a wonderful combination of bitter and sweet. Additionally, the hard snap of the dark chocolate was a pleasing texture. With the highest cocoa rating of the tasting, the Endangered Species chocolate was my favorite, for its aroma, taste and excellent pairing with the strawberry. I was surprised by my reaction to some of the chocolates, especially the white chocolate. As I don't typically gravitate toward white chocolate, I was appreciative of the opportunity to try some as a part of this tasting.† These fair trade chocolates are available to purchase at the I.V. Food Co-op. So, next time you are buying chocolate or coffee, make sure to always look out for the Fair Trade USA certification.

on-the-menu,Mylestone BBQ: A stellar one man show,23-Feb-23,2:40 PM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-23/mylestone-bbq-a-stellar-one-man-show/,"Chace Duma | Daily Nexus The first meal I remember truly loving was from a barbeque restaurant in my hometown when I was five or six. Eighteen years later, I still find it hard to beat a good barbeque meal. Barbeque summarizes everything I love about food. Barbeque is bold, it's passionate, it's messy, it's unapologetically delicious. So, obviously, I had to hop on the opportunity to review Mylestone Barbeque Co., a barbeque joint that just recently started serving lunches from Wednesday to Friday, with a special rib day on Sunday, out of Draughtsmen Aleworks in Goleta.† You wouldn't guess it, but Mylestone BBQ is a one-man operation. From cooking the meat, to hand-making the sauces, to mixing and packaging the seasonings he sells, pitmaster Charles Myles does it all. This respectable feat only grew more impressive once I experienced Mylestone for myself.† Mylestone BBQ serves sandwiches filled with your choice of three meats: tri-tip, pulled pork or barbeque chicken. Unfortunately, a sandwich wasn't an option for me î I can't eat gluten. Luckily, everything at Mylestone BBQ is gluten free (except, of course, the bread) and Myles was quick to make arrangements for me, loading up a plate with tri-tip, pulled pork and the slaw and pickles that usually go on the sandwich. He also offers a vinegar slaw, potato salad or street corn on the side, and occasionally a delicious dessert.† I brought my plate out back to the sitting area, a quiet, open patio surrounded by towering eucalyptus trees and tinged with that heavenly, bring-you-in-from-down-the-block BBQ aroma (one of the best smells in the world, if you ask me) and officially entered a world of barbeque bliss. I tried the pulled pork first, which was tender and seasoned wonderfully. The tri-tip was next and was equally impressive: beautifully smoky, crusted with Myles' signature tri-tip seasoning and cooked to perfection. The slaw was perfectly vinegary, light and crunchy, which balanced out the rich barbeque. Each bite I took further cemented the opinion I began to form after my first few bites: This is the best barbeque I've had in Santa Barbara.† After my first few bites, Myles came over to my table with a handful of sauces: a classic barbeque sauce, a spicy barbeque sauce, a horseradish mustard and a fermented hot sauce. All are handmade and all are delicious, adding a ton of flavor to the already flavorful meats. My favorites were the spicy barbeque and the fermented hot sauce, the latter of which Myles explained takes about a month to make. Both sauces balance the spice incredibly well; they're hot, but not unbearable, adding a kick without taking away from the experience of the meal. Myles explained that he wanted his hot sauce to be flavor forward, a goal I'd say he certainly achieved. The strong, floral flavors of the peppers are rounded out by garlic and the month of fermentation lends a complexity that brings it from great to even greater. I laid back in my chair, waves of heat and smoke rolling across my tongue, trying my best to make this meal last. I was in heaven.† As my plate quickly got emptier (a tragic consequence of a delicious meal), Myles came out to talk to myself and the other patron with whom I shared the patio. Through bites of tri-tip (impolite, I know, but I couldn't help myself), we had a lovely conversation, during which he shared the history of Mylestone BBQ.† After more than 20 years working an office job at a local tech company, Myles decided he needed an outlet, something to do for himself. So, in 2019, (the perfect year for anyone to begin a business venture), he started Mylestone BBQ, cooking his delicious tri-tip on a little Santa Maria grill from Costco. Business picked up quicker than expected, putting the Santa Maria to the test, and Myles was able to dedicate more and more of his time to Mylestone. Of course, shortly after, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Without a place to sell his BBQ due to lockdown, but unwilling to give up on Mylestone, Myles shifted to selling his seasoning blends (which he still does along with his hot sauce). As restrictions loosened, he started operations out of a shared kitchen in Goleta and operated a purely preorder and takeout business. Adapt, adapt, adapt.† Now a huge one-of-a-kind, custom-made barbeque takes the place of that little Santa Maria, and he has a mainstay at Draughtsmen Aleworks. Myles has since left his office job to pursue his Mylestone dream, something I'm always happy to hear, and he is looking to pick up as many barbeque-cooking days as he can.† A handshake and a thank-you later, I left stuffed and satisfied, already planning my next trip to Mylestone for Myles' Saturday rib special.† Mylestone BBQ is a must for barbeque lovers, or anyone looking to try a new spot in Goleta! Support a small, Black-owned business and give Mylestone BBQ a shot î you certainly won't regret it.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the February 23, 2023 edition of the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,Creaminal Minds: Ice Cream Sundaes on a Saturday,23-Feb-23,2:46 PM,['Abigail Nguyen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-23/creaminal-minds-ice-cream-sundaes-on-a-saturday/,"Courtesy of Creaminal As an avid ice cream eater and lover, I have about five half-eaten, freezer-burnt tubs of ice cream that I ordered off of Duffl out of convenience. But these bland and boring tubs are no solution to anyone's ice cream cravings. After going to the No Sad Sundaesù ice cream social ¶ like I did, you're about to throw them all away. These sundaes are so good, they're criminal. No Sad Sundaesù is an ice cream social held every Saturday night from 8-9 p.m. at Your Choice Thai Restaurant featuring Creaminal ice cream and unique toppings that compliment the ice cream flavors. The sundae menu rotates weekly, except for their crowd-favorite Mango Sticky Rice Sundae. Creaminal posts their flavors for the week on their Instagram @eatcreaminal.† Creaminal's ice cream flavors have me going back week after week to try new variations and special sundaes inspired by Asian American culture. When you walk into the restaurant, you're welcomed by the smiling faces of the owners of Creaminal and Your Choice Thai Restaurant, married couple Piti Sukavivatanachai and Kathy Dao who hand scoop your order and create your sundae right in front of you. They feature Creaminal branded merchandise on the walls and offer plenty of seating in the restaurant. Creaminal offers a free fast passù you can sign up for on their website for those who want to skip the line. I would definitely recommend getting it, as the line for No Sad Sundaesù wrapped around the corner of the restaurant! But, the staff moves very quickly so even if you have to wait, it probably wouldn't be for too long. So far, I have been to No Sad Sundaes on two separate occasions this year. On Jan. 21, I opted for the classic Mango Sticky Rice Sundae and the Strawberry Pistachio Sundae. Feeding into my new addiction, I came back to the ice cream social on Feb. 4 and chose the Boba Milk Tea and the Banana S'mores Sundae.† The Mango Sticky Rice Sundae features their creamy and refreshing mango ice cream that manages to not overpower the amazing coconut sticky rice underneath the giant scoop of ice cream. The sticky rice was my favorite part of the sundae. It had just the right amount of chewiness and coconut flavor that complimented the mango ice cream perfectly. It was topped with a creamy coconut sauce and butter-toasted rice crispies that added a crunchy texture. This sundae brought me back to my childhood when my mom would make mango sticky rice for us on special occasions, and this sundae flawlessly executed their take on this Asian dish while evoking feelings of comfort and wistful familiarity. I will order this again and again and tell everyone I know about it. The Strawberry Pistachio Sundae had strawberry ice cream, strawberry coulis, pistachio drizzle and strawberry shortcake crumble. The ice cream was slightly sweet with a fresh flavor; the coulis and drizzle were nice additions, adding a bit more sweetness and nuttiness while the shortcake crumble brought nostalgic memories of the strawberry shortcake bars found at ice cream trucks. I rated this sundae an 8/10 for its great take on classic strawberry ice cream, but I needed more hints of pistachio to make it dynamic. The Boba Milk Tea Sundae featured a sweet and distinct Hong Kong milk tea ice cream flavor, chewy and perfectly cooked honey boba, classic grass jelly, and black sugar sauce to top it off. This sundae was absolutely delicious, taking boba milk tea to a new level by fusing two of my favorite desserts into one. This sundae earns a score of 9/10 for its strong flavors, and it was off the charts on topping textures. The ice cream was slightly sweet but still amazingly delicious. The Banana S'mores Sundae featured light and fresh roasted banana ice cream, topped with a large torched marshmallow and chocolate sauce. It also had a graham cracker crunch topping and crushed banana chips which paired effortlessly with the notes of banana and marshmallow. I rate this sundae a 10/10. It's absolutely photo-ready, and I'm telling all the banana lovers to order it next time they come. My experience at the No Sad Sundaesù ice cream social was absolutely amazing. From the friendly faces of staff to the comforting atmosphere to the hand scooped sundaes, Creaminal truly offers high-quality ice cream made by high-quality people. If you're looking for a new dessert spot, the No Sad Sundaesù ice cream social is the place to go. I'll be coming back every Saturday to try a new sundae, so I hope to see you at the next one!

on-the-menu,What's new in Old Town Goleta: Oat Bakery's second location,2-Mar-23,9:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-02/whats-new-in-old-town-goleta-oat-bakerys-second-location/,"The bakery has an espresso bar and sells varieties of vinegar and other local food products alongside their freshly baked loaves. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Oat Bakery, a locally owned and operated business, opened its second location at 231 Magnolia Ave. in Old Town Goleta at the end of 2022. This is the Scandinavian bakery's second Santa Barbara location, with its first bakery located at 5 West Haley St.† The storefront was previously home to Goodland Kitchen, a bakery and commercial kitchen space for local chefs that closed in 2021. Despite all the previous businesses that have occupied the space, a piece of local history still remains to keep the spirit of Old Town alive: the historic La Esmeralda Market sign that hangs above the entryway.† While Oat Bakery is tucked away on a side street off of Hollister Avenue, its crisp white exterior with outdoor seating, a pizza oven and accents painted in the establishment's signature blue color invite you in to enjoy a breakfast pastry or light lunch.† The establishment is known for its freshly baked loaves and other goodies made with organic and local ingredients, producing varieties such as their Date/Almond Loaf, Maple Miso Scallion Whole-Wheat Focaccia and gluten-free Hot Date Cookies. These flavors pay homage to the Danish background of owner Louise Ulrich, whose mother Else Ulrich developed a health-conscious bread recipe composed of organic grains and seeds that Ulrich ate growing up.† A generous 1,700 square feet of space has allowed the bakery more room to breathe and expand compared to its more compact location on Haley Street. Upon entering, customers can observe employees preparing and baking fresh loaves thanks to the eatery's open floor plan and exposed kitchen. The front display case presents the featured loaves and pastries of the day while a humble menu, in the form of labeled strips of masking tape placed atop the counter, reads off breakfast and lunch menu items. Oat Bakery is very much a no-frills, all-flavor-type eatery.† While they wait, customers can enjoy a coffee beverage from Oat Bakery's espresso bar, brewed with beans from Danish coffee roastery Prolog, or purchase bottles of Graza olive oil and Sideyard Shrubs fruit vinegar, the perfect accouterments to accompany a freshly baked loaf of bread.† Dishes on Oat Bakery's lunch and breakfast menu include varieties of sandwiches served on housemade focaccia and a delicata quiche slice. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus On a sunny day in late January, I visited the bakery with a friend for lunch. I ordered the quiche slice, an item from their brunch menu (which they serve until noon). This generous, square-shaped slice featured a lightly toasted top, creamy bites of roasted delicata squash, shreds of spinach and a thin yet flaky crust. Each bite simply melted in my mouth in the best way possible. My friend enjoyed a veggie sandwich featuring butter lettuce, cucumber and avocado, sandwiched between two airy pieces of Oat Bakery's focaccia bread topped with sizable flakes of sea salt. The outdoor patio was a pleasant place to catch up and enjoy a meal under the Santa Barbara sun. I returned a second time on a rainy early afternoon in February to try another item off their lunch menu, their Rancho Gordo lima beans with roasted tomatoes, garlic and serrano peppers with a side of bread and butter. Inclement weather poses a challenge for Oat Bakery whose seating is primarily outside, but I was able to enjoy my warm bowl of beans at one of the two high top tables inside. The lima beans were cooked to perfection, floating in a simple and slightly tangy broth among slivers of garlic. Two slices of bread served as vessels for soaking up every last bit of the broth. I'm definitely going to try to recreate a variation of this cozy dish at home (but I doubt I'll come close to achieving the same depth of flavors).† Oat Bakery's Rancho Gordo lima beans are served with stewed tomatoes and a side of bread with butter. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus With many new restaurants always trying to be flashier than the last, I valued Oat Bakery's loyalty to simplicity. I'm an indecisive person, so for once it's nice to just have a few great options made from high quality, local ingredients from which to choose when ordering a meal. Don't let its limited menu fool you; after visiting the bakery twice I still have so many baked goods and dishes left to try. I'm keeping my eye out for the day they start serving housemade pizzas made in their outdoor pizza oven.† In an area dominated by auto repair shops and decades-old restaurants, Oat Bakery's warm and welcoming presence will hopefully breathe new life into Old Town Goleta.

on-the-menu,Reviewing TikTok's mini-confections cereal trend,9-Mar-23,11:27 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-09/reviewing-tiktoks-mini-confections-cereal-trend/,"Abigail Monti | Daily Nexus There was a period of time not too long ago when TikTok users couldn't open the app without seeing a bowl of tiny pancakes floating in milk. While Sydney Melhoff's bowl of dime-sized pancakes doused in milk kick-started the trend in 2020, creative cereal variations continue to take the world by storm.† As someone who refuses to download TikTok for various compelling and totally valid reasons (read: stubbornness), I came across this cereal trend admittedly later than most. If anything, the fact that I witnessed this trend on Instagram î which is notoriously months behind on the latest TikTok fads î before it fizzled out completely speaks to the longevity of this cereal craze.† While the phase of pancake cereal has begun to subside, increasingly sweeter and more labor-intensive mini confections are still dominating social media. I've witnessed mini muffins, doughnuts, cinnamon rolls, cookies, croissants, waffles, french toasts and more being drowned in milk. You can bet that a TikTok user somewhere has splashed milk on a mini version of pretty much every confection out there.† Some variations are more feasible than others. Yet the more outrageous the idea, the more views the video tends to get î like these individually shaped, iced and sprinkled mini donuts boasting close to a million views. The factor of milk also adds to the trend's impracticality: Any miniature baked good is likely to turn soggy within seconds of touching milk.† And yet the world can't get enough of it. So what makes this trend so popular? Well, first of all, it's an excuse to turn dessert into breakfast. Reminiscent of beloved childhood cereals like Cookie Crisp, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Pop-Tarts cereal, the confection cereal trend is guaranteed to satisfy any sweet tooth. And while it might not be the most nutrient dense breakfast option, sugars, starches and other carbohydrate-heavy foods are proven to boost serotonin levels. The combination of sugar and nostalgia brings comfort for those† eating mini breads, pastries and other nostalgic carbs for breakfast.† The second reason contributing to the trend's popularity is the fact that people simply love tiny things. From HGTV's tiny home show to BuzzFeed's tiny chef videos to those tiny erasers that had every middle schooler in a chokehold circa 2015, tiny things are known to make people smile. Needlessly complex yet undeniably adorable, there's something inherently aesthetic about miniature replicas of ordinarily large things. Having done my research and thoroughly convinced that this trend was going to change my life, I set out to make my own cereal. Out of respect to the trend's origin, I started with mini pancakes. The process was similar to making regular pancakes, just slower and more tedious. I spent a few rounds struggling to flip the mini pancakes with a spatula before realizing a fork was the superior tool. Eventually, I gave up on perfectly round dimes and shot for abstract quarters instead, which also helped speed up the process.† When my bowl was finally complete, I drizzled the pile of mini pancakes with syrup and doused them in milk. Afraid they would become exponentially soggy with time, I immediately wolfed the little guys down. Unfortunately, that meant the bowl I just spent half an hour meticulously making was gone in less than a minute. But to be honest, I didn't really care î it was delicious.† For my more sugary variation, I chose to make mini-chocolate-chip-cookie cereal. I followed the same recipe I normally would for cookies, except I used a teaspoon to measure each cookie and let them crisp up a little more than I usually would. I used a mug as my receptacle.†† The cookies seemed to absorb the milk much more than the pancakes and began disintegrating rather quickly. While the cereal's structure didn't last long, it's hard to go wrong with milk and cookies.† While mini pancakes and cookies aren't the most practical breakfasts, I don't regret participating in the newest TikTok trend. Surprisingly, I ended up liking the pancakes slightly more than the cookies. Ultimately, I probably wouldn't make either cereal version again, but that's more due to laziness than dislike.† Will the mini-dessert cereal trend last? It's hard to say. I struggle to imagine anything topping the complexity of mini-latticed-cherry-pie cereal, but the creativity of TikTok continues to surprise me time and time again.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the March 9, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,Raspberry Olive Oil Hamantaschen,9-Mar-23,11:29 AM,['Joey Sable'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-09/raspberry-olive-oil-hamantaschen/,"Joey Sable | Daily Nexus Growing up in a religious Jewish home, Purim was unarguably the best holiday of the entire year. While the holiday's narrative is centered around the persecution and eventual perseverance of the Jewish people in Ancient Persia in line with most Jewish holidays, the traditions associated with the holiday essentially defines Purim as the òJewish Halloween.' People traditionally dress up as both characters from the religious narrative, the Megillah (Book of Esther),ù as well as anything and everything. The emulation of an elaborate feast and such food goodies like hamantaschen, the spread-filled sugar cookie named after the holiday narrative's villain, are delectable and so easily consumable.† Hamantaschen have become a staple in Jewish culture as a result of the exchange between non-Jewish Germans and German Jewish populations around the 1500s. Its origins are rooted in a German medieval pastry called mohntaschen, translated to poppy seed pockets. It is inferred that German Jews claimed the cookies for the holiday, likely referencing that the villain's pockets are corrupted and filled with stolen money and bribes. To this day, one of the most common Hamantaschen fillings is mohn- poppy seed. In line with Jewish food standards, hamantaschen can be made dairy or pareve- that is the neutral standard of kashrut that is neither meat nor dairy- but since the Purim feast is usually dairy-based, hamantaschen most likely consumed around Purim are dairy. ††† In retrospect, it is blatantly obvious that Purim was the vehicle in which I could express my queerness within the confines of the religious standards I grew up governed by. Dressing effeminately or cross-dressing were permissible as it was relative in the tradition of the holiday, and I absolutely took advantage of it. Throughout elementary school, some of the costumes I adorned included Tracy Turnblad from the musical Hairspray,ù an old grandma and a 1970s female hippie. Aspects of the Purim narrative and holiday traditions feel and appear queer, and it can be inferred without a doubt that the holiday served as a vehicle of gender and identity expression for queer Jews for hundreds and hundreds of years.††††† This Purim, I aimed to find and eventually claim a hamantaschen recipe that perfectly encapsulated the childhood nostalgia of holiday festivities: one that was pareve (non-dairy), with a fruity center and a slightly citrusy sugar cookie. I found Jamie Geller's Olive Oil Hamantaschen recipe on her website and fell in love with it. This recipe is practically her exact recipe with a few tweaks to make it my own î my version of queering the holiday in my own authentic way. You can absolutely sub the raspberry jam filling for any sweet filling of your choice; in my opinion, raspberry jam compliments the cookie so well, but apricot jam or chocolate spread also compliment.†† YIELD: 36 cookies† TIME: 30 minutes Ingredients: Directions: Hamantaschen are usually made and eaten around the Purim holiday, but you can find cases of hamantaschen at most Jewish delis or appetizing stores. They are so delectable and easy to eat that you will crave them year-round.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the March 9, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.†

Just as I'm admiring the plate, she turns the phone and laughs in my face, besmirching my dinner and everything I stand for.† Just as I'm about to give up and settle for what will be my fourth instant ramen, I remember I know how to cook! And better yet, I know it doesn't take that much energy. I love comfort food, especially when it's super easy to make. Sopes are fried, bowl-like tortillas topped with cream, beans, chicken and, classically, lettuce, radish, cheese and salsa.

on-the-menu,One-pan butternut squash saute,28-Mar-23,11:55 AM,['Maya Salem'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-28/one-pan-butternut-squash-saute/,"Maya Salem | Daily Nexus I was tricked into eating butternut squash at a young age. My older sister had just told me about these great new shredded carrots at the salad bar in our favorite restaurant. As a massive fan of carrots, after having recently learned of their superpower-granting nutrients that allow me to see in the dark, I was sold. Though the shredded carrots were a slightly lighter orange than normal, I piled them high on my plate. I got back to our table, my sister watching my every move. As I loaded up my fork and began to taste their sweet, crunchy and slightly nutty flavor, I looked at her with surprise. No, they clearly weren't carrots, but they were good! To her utter disappointment, that was the day I fell in love with butternut squash. Years later, I look for every versatile form of this orange, vitamin A-rich squash: soup, roasted, fried, raw, etc. So, to my surprise, when I saw a Trader Joe's product that looks like raw crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that said butternut squashù on the packaging, of course I had to buy it.† This one-pan butternut squash saute has become my go-to weekday meal. It's warm, it's vegetarian and its lavish, earthy flavors just hit the spot during winter. † Ingredients: Directions: If your New Year's resolution is to eat more vegetables or to cook more, this is the perfect place to start. This one-pot meal is friendly to your budget, your health and your dish-washing energy.

on-the-menu,"Panino: A vegetarian-friendly, local sandwich spot",4-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-04/panino-a-vegetarian-friendly-local-sandwich-spot/,"The Black and White Panino includes olive tapenade, roasted red peppers, lettuce and mozzarella. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus I must admit, I've never been the biggest fan of sandwiches. Something about wrestling a towering mass of bread, subpar condiments, overly dry or watery deli meat, slimy tomatoes and floppy lettuce into my mouth seemed like too much effort with too great of a mess involved. Yet, at the same time, lunch is typically the most difficult meal for me to put together î do I keep pretending that I'm still enjoying the bagel and cream cheese I've been eating for months on end or try to whip up something quick and satisfying without running late to my afternoon classes? Recently, I've been on the hunt for affordable lunch spots in Santa Barbara and Goleta î restaurants that have menu items in the $10-$15 range and have a selection of vegetarian-friendly options for me to choose from that are more creative than a slice of cheese pizza or a bean and cheese burrito. Panino, a family-owned and Santa Barbara-based sandwich shop, fits my criteria.† Panino has six locations across Santa Barbara County, with the closest location in proximity to UC Santa Barbara on Calle Real in Goleta. This humble-looking lunch spot serves up Italian-inspired sandwiches and salads with the freshest ingredients. As a vegetarian, my options for sandwich combinations are pretty limited and often pretty pathetic. I will no longer settle for bland hummus, greens and sliced veggies on whole wheat bread; I'm looking for something with a little more substance! Panino understands the vegetarian's conundrum and provides not one, not two but a list of nine, delectable, meatless sandwiches, silencing any jealousy I held toward the list of options for meat-eaters.†† I've tried several of Panino's vegetarian sandwiches, which are all priced at $13.95 yet are served in two large halves and big enough to split with a friend, meaning both of you could enjoy a delicious lunch for just $7! If I could only eat one sandwich for the rest of my life, it would have to be The Greek Sandwich from Panino, made with house-made Kalamata olive tapenade, feta, cucumber, red onion, tomato and greens with your choice of bread î I always choose their focaccia that perfectly offsets the saltiness of the tapenade. Panino's vegetables are never soggy and wilted, providing a good crunch factor.† Another favorite of mine from Panino's vegetarian menu is the Artichoke Hearts, Tomato & Fresh Mozzarella sandwich, which consists of marinated artichoke hearts, mozzarella, tomato, basil green leaf, mayonnaise and freshly squeezed lemon. This one is so tasty, I completely forgot about my previous hatred for mayonnaise. I'm not one to think about putting a hunk of mozzarella and whole basil leaves in a sandwich but when Panino does it, it just makes sense.† Panino's meatless offerings all sound very similar in theory, with most referencing the tried-and-true Italian pairing of tomato and cheese, but each sandwich still has its own distinct flavors. Take the Black and White Panino, for example, a sandwich whose ingredients are very similar to The Greek Sandwich, but the addition of roasted red peppers and the absence of onion gives it a milder flavor.† I've given rave reviews of the vegetarian sandwiches, but trying bites of friends' Curried Chicken Salad or Roast Chicken W/ Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Fresh Basil & Provolone sandwiches has convinced me that all of Panino's sandwiches prioritize quality ingredients and thoughtfully balanced flavor combinations. My discovery of this locally owned lunch spot was enough to make me finally understand the goodness that is a freshly made sandwich.†

Maya Salem / Daily Nexus While pineapples usually invoke distant memories of summer and spark rigorous debate over their place on pizza or even the best way to cut one, there is one thing that can be agreed upon. In Southern California, they are available nearly year-round. And there's nothing better than slicing the spiky side of a wonderfully ripe pineapple in the middle of January. Well, perhaps there are some things that might be better. Like the meet-cute of salty butter and smooth olive oil atop crispy fingerling potatoes. Fortunately, this fresh and filling meal gives you both. This is not a typical salsa. You can scoop it up with a spoon to get all its flavorful and fresh goodness. And though the smashed potatoes are crispy enough to use as a vessel for the salsa, they are also just a wonderful side dish. Overflowing with vitamin C and protein, this colorful meal is satisfying and healthy. Yield: 3 cups salsa Time: 35 minutes† Ingredients: Salsa: Potatoes: Directions: Between the fresh sweetness of the pineapple and the addictive crunch of the potatoes, I find myself looking forward to this meal all day. Sometimes I'll add an avocado to the mix or some fresh grilled corn. Take out the Cotija and it's a plant-based delight. Dip the smashed potatoes into some guacamole? Say no more.

on-the-menu,Battle of the Dairy-Free Yogurts,13-Apr-23,10:00 AM,['Cindy Phan'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-13/battle-of-the-dairy-free-yogurts/,"Michelle Wu / Daily Nexus Starting off a long day with a refreshing breakfast is necessary for me. Yogurt bowls have slowly become my go-to breakfast because of how easy they are to make in the morning. While delicious, yogurt bowls are a lactose-intolerant person's nightmare. I wanted to transition my diet toward being dairy-free, but I didn't want to give up my favorite breakfast due to my lactose intolerance. With so many dairy-free yogurts on the market, I went on the hunt for the best one.† Dairy-free yogurts tend to have a coconut, cashew or almond base. I wanted to try multiple brands to find the dairy-free yogurt that was most reminiscent of my favorite variety: a thick and creamy Greek yogurt. My friend Cayla joined me on this dairy-free yogurt taste test and helped me rate all the yogurts based on the texture and taste.† The first candidate was Kite Hill Greek Style Plant-Based Yogurt, which has 17 grams of protein per serving. This is a special high-protein yogurt, which is unique because most plant-based yogurts typically have around 3-8 grams of protein. I personally thought this yogurt was a 6/10 because of its grainy texture that was not as creamy and light as traditional Greek yogurt. The taste was not too powerful and the slight vanilla flavor was not too powerful and offered a different taste than plain Greek yogurt. Unless I really wanted a high-protein breakfast, I would pass on this option.† Next, Cayla and I tried the Forager Project's Organic Probiotic Cashewmilk Yogurt. I gravitated toward this yogurt due to its cashew base as I hadn't tried many cashew-based products previously. I rated this yogurt an 8.5/10 while Cayla rated it a 7/10. Forager's has a light and refreshing flavor while also having a thick consistency, reminiscent of the Greek yogurt I typically reach for, although it was not the thickest in this group.† Open Nature's Dairy-Free Coconut Yogurt Alternative was the third one we tried. I was initially skeptical of this option because of its coconut base and I am not the biggest fan of coconut. I gave this option a chance because I was hoping the plain variety meant it wouldn't taste too strongly of coconut. I was wrong! After one bite, I instantly rated this yogurt a 3/10.† Despite the packaging's claim that the yogurt was creamy, the yogurt's had a thin consistency and overwhelming coconutty flavor. I definitely do not think this yogurt was as creamy as it claims to be on the packaging. Cayla on the other hand rated it a 7/10: I like it but I know I wouldn't be able to eat this everyday.ù Unless you're a coconut fan, pass on this yogurt.† The last plain yogurt was my favorite: Trader Joe's Organic Creamy Cashew Cultured Yogurt Alternative. This has been my go-to yogurt because of its thick and creamy texture. Since I used to work at Trader Joe's, this yogurt always made it on my weekly grocery list. Upon opening the container, you could see how the yogurt jiggles in the container from how thick it is. I rate this one a 9/10 because it reminds me the most of dairy yogurt. Cayla agrees that it was a 9/10 and says that she could not have guessed that it was plant-based. She says it's equally as good as dairy yogurt!† Switching to a dairy-free diet should not mean giving up eating your favorite foods. While some products are definitely hit-or-miss, there are so many exciting dairy-free alternatives to try. I couldn't have known that coconut-based yogurts were not my favorite or learned that I prefer cashew-based yogurts unless I tried them. All in all, Cayla and I both love the Trader Joe's yogurt and highly recommend everyone to give it a chance.† So, after this journey of finding the best yogurt, here is the updated breakfast staple recipe.† My go to yogurt bowl consists of:† With any type of breakfast, it can be customized to your liking. I also like to rotate the fruit I use in my yogurt bowls, whether that be bananas or dates. Feel free to try out my yogurt bowl and put your own spin on it!† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the April 13, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.†

on-the-menu,A guide to cannabis beverages and consuming consciously,20-Apr-23,10:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/a-guide-to-cannabis-beverages-and-consuming-consciously/,"When you're sipping on your infused cocktail that is soon to replace your alcohol of choice, remember that while the plant is fun to consume, there's still work to be done regarding criminal justice reform, cannabis legalization and inclusivity. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Lately, more and more people are cutting alcohol out of their lives, reaching for one of the hundreds of nonalcoholic beverages available in supermarkets nationwide, making their own mocktails or settling for plain old water in exchange for a life without hangovers. Not drinking is an emerging trend among Gen Z, as BBC reported that among US adults, a Gallup poll showed that those aged 35 to 54 are most likely to drink alcohol (70%), compared to Gen Zers (60%) and Boomers (52%). For nondrinkers looking for alternative ways to get a buzz, there's yet another avenue: cannabis-infused beverages.† Infused beverages are a growing market within the cannabis industry. High Times reports that cannabis beverages only represent about one percent of overall legal cannabis sales in the U.S., yet more mainstream food and beverage companies are slowly entering the space, such as the manufacturers of Budweiser, Modelo Especial and Pabst Blue Ribbon. The appeal of these beverages lies in their faster metabolization process than other edibles, meaning users can feel the effects faster. Still, with a more limited selection of infused beverages available at cannabis dispensaries, consumers are more likely to reach for weed gummies, chocolate bars and other ingestibles.† Some cannabis users infuse beverages themselves, using either store-bought or homemade tinctures and syrups to add an extra something to their drinks. Anna Li, who uses the handle @cannabinista on TikTok and @cannabinista.co on Instagram, has built an online community by sharing her cannabis-infused recipes. Using her toolbox of special infusion and decarboxylation devices, Li can turn any recipe into an infused one. Craving a whiskey sour that doesn't contain any alcohol or popsicles that are refreshing and relaxation-inducing at the same time? Li's website has tons of recipes and ways to add weed into any food or drink.† The community guidelines of most social media apps prohibit content showing the use of illegal drugs. Unfortunately, despite weed's legality in many states, the plant has been lumped into a grouping of illegal drugs,ù whose presence is forbidden on such social media feeds. This makes finding cannabis-related content, such as Li's recipes, increasingly difficult on TikTok since creators must use pseudonyms when referring to weed or they'll risk the removal of their content. Regardless of these limitations, the cannabis consumables market is still growing and diminishing the stigma surrounding weed, which might result in the future loosening of these social media guidelines.† Those who feel inspired by Li's content and the growing cannabis consumables market might feel inclined to whip up their own weed tincture or powder that can be incorporated into a wide range of recipes. However, the process of making a tincture is time intensive and involves decarboxylating the flower in the oven, soaking the flower in food-grade alcohol and storing the mixture in a dark, dry place for a few weeks before filtering it for eventual consumption. Additionally, safely dosing such tinctures yourself can be difficult.† If you're weary of attempting to make your own tincture in fear of ingesting more cannabis than anticipated, opt for one of the canned, infused beverages available for purchase at legal cannabis dispensaries. Several of these drinks, such as a 10 milligram can of Keef Brands's Bubba Kush Root Beer, can be consumed straight out of the can and even accompanied by a meal. Other infused drinks with milder flavors and lower dosages, such as Cann's Cannabis-Infused Social Tonic, which contains 2 milligrams of THC and 4 milligrams of CBD per serving, can be combined with a few other ingredients to create a more sophisticated infused drink. Consuming legal cannabis comes with a degree of privilege. While Californians and those in a handful of other states can enjoy access to legal, recreational cannabis, we cannot forget about the tens of thousands of people incarcerated for cannabis possession î many of who still remain incarcerated today. The Last Prisoner Project is a nonprofit organization that works toward the freedom of Americans incarcerated for cannabis charges through education, policy reform, legal assistance and resources for formerly incarcerated constituents. The Last Prisoner Project invites people to take action toward cannabis policy reform by writing letters to currently incarcerated cannabis prisoners, calling on state governors to pardon those convicted of federal marijuana possession and donating to their organization to support their prisoner release programs and reentry programs.† To continue consuming cannabis consciously, the UCSB and Isla Vista community can shop atBIPOC-owned cannabis brands and storefronts. Based on an American Civil Liberties Union report of marijuana arrest data from 2010-18, the New York Times reports that while studies show white and Black people use marijuana at similar rates, a Black person is more than three times as likely to be arrested for possession than a white person. The war on drugs and the disproportionate number of people of color arrested for possession has led to barriers of entry into the majority white-owned cannabis industry. Some states have launched social equity efforts to bridge this gap and give everyone the opportunity to receive assistance in landing a job in the cannabis industry or starting their own cannabis business.† To ensure equal opportunity in the cannabis space, it is imperative that cannabis business owners support each other. The infused beverage company Cann has partnered with organizations that work to promote inclusion within the cannabis space such as Cannaclusive, a collective dedicated to facilitating fair representation of minorities in cannabis.ù Cannaclusive created a database of 1,032 BIPOC-owned cannabis companies to support in the U.S. in an effort to uplift minorities who are underrepresented and overlooked in the industry. This database makes it easy for consumers to directly support BIPOC-owned businesses in their home state. Here's a recipe for a relaxing cannabis-infused cocktail that is guaranteed to be hangover-free: This infused beverage is guaranteed hangover-free. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Yield: 1 drink Time: 5 minutes† Ingredients: Directions: When you're sipping on your infused cocktail that is soon to replace your alcohol of choice, remember that while the plant is fun to consume, there's still work to be done regarding criminal justice reform, cannabis legalization and inclusivity. Yet, your actions and advocacy can play a role in working to free those incarcerated for cannabis charges, reducing the stigma surrounding weed and expanding the cannabis industry to include everyone.

on-the-menu,The munchie roundup: I.V. edition,20-Apr-23,10:00 AM,"['Stephanie Gerson', 'Abigail Monti', 'Mari Villalpando-Ortega', 'Editor in Chief', 'Imke Galts']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/the-munchie-roundup-i-v-edition/,"Spudnuts and Dank Bowls Kitchen are two of the most popular munchie destinations. Jessie Zhu / Daily Nexus A widely celebrated holiday in California and especially Isla Vista begins as the sun rises on April 20. Honestly, more students would benefit from having 4/20 off from school than Election Day (that's what mail-in ballots are for, anyway). But until that motion passes, you can count on a conspicuous number of red-eyed classmates to show up to lecture this Thursday. Whether you find the will to carry on with regularly scheduled activities or choose to spend the day lounging at home with friends, you'll want to be prepared with the proper snack assortment. However, note that not all munchies are created equal. We asked the Daily Nexus staff to pitch their favorite high cuisines to ensure this 4/20 is your most enjoyable experience yet.† Spudnuts Donuts Any raving case of the munchies can be appeased with a solid donut. Sadly, there's a dearth of donut shops in the area surrounding UC Santa Barbara, limiting my options to a sad bag of Little Debbie Donuts from 7-Eleven or whatever's left at Spudnuts at the end of the night when my munchies roll around. Unlike typical donut shops, Spudnuts uses potato flour to create their donuts, a practice dating back to 1946. I've had the same donut order since the age of five when I would accompany my siblings to our hometown donut shop in the Bay Area, Chuck's Donuts, after school: It has always been, and always will be, a chocolate old-fashioned donut. Maybe a bag of donut holes too. Oh how I miss Chuck's and the fact that they were open 24/7 ¶ I digress. Compared to a bag of chips or candy, a really good old-fashioned donut is more satisfying as it's denser, not overpoweringly sweet and there's no disappointing reach into the bottom of the bag only to find out there's nothing leftù feeling you get when scooping handful after handful of chips from the bag. Plus, a donut pairs nicely with a refreshing glass of milk î in my case, almond milk î to wash it all down and quench my thirst, or in certain cases cotton mouth. My only critique of Spudnuts is their shockingly early closing time of 8 p.m., but I guess I can plan accordingly and snag a donut before they close their doors for the night and my evening shenanigans unfold.† Fried tofu for a fried brain The munchies always present a different craving. Sometimes you'd like a sweet, creamy treat, and other times you want a savory, spicy snack. Every time I feel like I need a little savory something, my first trip is always to Kaiju for some delicious fried tofu. It's crunchy, well spiced and absolutely divine for the fried brain. I fixate on the satisfyingly crispy outside and relish the soft tofu inside in a way only the high brain can comprehend.† And of course, let's not forget about the most annoying symptom of smoking: cotton mouth. Kaiju's grand variety of delicious boba helps. I always love some Hokkaido milk tea with egg pudding. The sweet milk tea is quite a lovely pair to the fried tofu. Have the munchies? Definitely check out Kaiju!
 Dank Bowl Kitchen Oh, Dank Bowl Kitchen ¶ is this too obvious of an answer? I don't care. No one is there for me like Dank Bowls's Mac Daddy. There is a delightful range of sauces to choose from, transforming the ordinary (but oh so extraordinary!) mac and cheese into a flavor bomb of your choosing. Personally, I am a pesto aioli loyalist. A comparable flavor range is offered for the toppings, including chipotle black beans, pickled jalape√±os, pico de gallo, roasted veggies, mashed potatoes and even Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Dank Bowl Kitchen offers a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian options î my favorite is the pulled jackfruit î and even has a gluten-free rice bowl, ensuring that no person suffering from a raging case of the munchies in I.V. is excluded. If Dank Bowl Kitchen is pandering to the stoner community, I say let them. The creamy richness of their mac and cheese paired with the pleasant firmness of their sourdough bowls will satisfy any munchies.† Deja Vu Cafe The Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries at Deja Vu are a must have after that 1 a.m. bad trip. Luckily, this classic munchie destination stays open until 2:30 a.m. Thursday through Saturday. Jordeen still owes me $12.49 from the last time we went, but the value of them putting me on to these fries was priceless. However, be warned that this munchie is not for the faint of stomach (or for a weak flush of the toilet). Munchie miscellany My munchie selection ranges from completely unexpected to pretty predictable. For example, okra is a vegetable neglected by many, but don't miss out on Trader Joe's Crispy Crunchy Okra dipped in chive cream cheese for the ultimate late-night munchie. Another go-to snack is premade cookie dough (especially snickerdoodle flavor). This munchie comes with a couple semi-requirements: 1) someone bought the dough. 2) Someone is sober enough to operate an oven or is the kind of high where they are able to function. If these two conditions are met, freshly baked cookies are divine. Last but not least, homemade weed brownies. Listen, you are already high, but let's get even higher by having a nibble of a gorgeous weed brownie with walnuts. Trust me, it will overindulge your senses in the best way. Late night in the 7-Eleven candy aisle In my experience, most people tend to go straight to sour, fruity candy when the munchies strike: anything from NERDS Gummy Clusters, Sour Patch Kids and Haribo Twin Snakes, to those weird push-pop popsicle things that were cool back in second grade. I've never quite understood the connection between inebriated taste buds and citric acid, but then again, I don't understand why my boyfriend's go-to munchie meal is a homemade rack of barbeque ribs. Personally, my favorite late-night snack is, and forever will be, Peanut M&M's.† Sure, it's a little old school, but there's no need to keep developing new kinds of enamel-eroding sour candy when the original movie theater snack is already perfection. Odds are you and your friends are already sunken between couch cushions watching an animated film meant for elementary schoolers anyway. Why not lean into the theme and pick up a pack of microwave popcorn at 7-Eleven while you're at it? Some people think I'm weird for this, but mixing Peanut M&M's and popcorn together makes some damn good trail mix. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Sour and fruity has nothing on the superior combo of sweet and salty. Nature's sour candy The perfect munchies? Frozen grapes î the green ones of course. Something about that icy natural sourness just understands me, you know? Luckily, the Isla Vista Food Cooperative and Isla Vista Market carry this superior fruit. Just make sure to plan this particular munchie in advance, as the produce selection in the local grocery stores dwindles as the day goes on, and the grapes need at least two hours to freeze completely.

on-the-menu,Happy accidents: the trials and tribulations in the search for artificial sweeteners,27-Apr-23,10:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-27/happy-accidents-the-trials-and-tribulations-in-the-search-for-artificial-sweeteners/,"Katya Kiseleva / Daily Nexus Stevia. Splenda. Equal. All are traditionally recognized as artificial sweeteners, found in every Starbucks and every Dunkin Donuts. But has anyone heard of oubli? This West African fruit is nature's very own artificial sweetener, if you will. Oubli contains a soluble protein known as brazzein, which has a sweetness 500-2000 times that of sucrose, thus tricking primates into consuming it in large quantities in hopes of caloric compensation, without really lending any. Other naturally sweet plant proteins, such as thaumatin and monellin, fall in the same vein of trickery î the former of which has even been approved as a flavor and sweet enhancer. These proteins, like most things in nature, are no accident: they are a calculated evolutionary effort, planned alongside human evolution to take advantage of their inherent taste for sweetness and its association with caloric value.† However, for as much effort as was put in by nature to bring about these sweeteners, as little was put into their discovery and commercialization; not because scientists weren't working around the clock to discover sugar substitutes, but because of the complex nature of sweetness detection. On a molecular level, sweetness is detected by two different receptors in our tongues: T1R3 and T1R2. So long as a molecule can fit, like a keyù into the receptor lock,ù the taste of sweetness can be replicated binding the sugar and enzyme, producing chemicals that carry signals to the gustatory cortex, helping us perceive sweetness. This is how compounds such as saccharin and aspartame, found in Sweet'N Low and Equal, are able to mimic the effects of sucrose (table sugar).† Scientists have been hard at work in search of the perfect artificial sweetener since before the 1950s , mainly to reduce costs but also to protect consumer health and providing a diet-friendlyù zero calorie alternative. Replicating the latency (how long the sweet flavor lasts) and intensity of regular sugar without the caloric weight, however, has proved a difficult task. Because the exact shape which fits into the receptor enzymes has not yet been determined, it is impossible to single out compounds that will elicit this response. Furthermore, scientists cannot yet rule out the existence of other sweet taste receptors that may be interacting with these artificial sweeteners. So, how do we even have the sweeteners we do now? Many were actually discovered by accident. Saccharin, for example, was discovered in 1878 by Constantin Fahlberg when he ate a bread roll without washing his hands after a day of laboratory work and found it to be remarkably sweet. Fahlberg rushed back to the lab to identify the source, thus discovering the first commercially viable alternative to cane sugar.† Unfortunately, some of the sweeteners the food industry has come to rely on have recently been found to cause detrimental effects to human health, which may outweigh their supposed health benefits. Aspartame (found in cereals and chewing gum) has recently been found to increase the risk of chronic anxiety and stroke in users and could even be passed onto future generations. Similar effects have been observed with overuse of sucralose as well, which only made its entry in the artificial sweetener market in the 1980s. A lesser evil of these sweeteners is also the slight bitter aftertaste that they often leave, as a result of binding of the artificial sweetener to both the sweet and bitter taste receptors.† Knowing the negative health effects brought about from commonly used sweeteners makes the search for other artificial sweeteners more pertinent than ever. The latest artificial sweetener, allulose, was found in 2015 and received FDA approval in 2019. A naturally occurring substance found in figs and raisins, allulose has yet to show any harmful effects, leaving scientists and users alike cautiously optimistic. Perhaps our future lies in our past, in naturally sweet plant proteins, which might become viable options once they are evaluated for toxicity and possible harmful effects, like allulose. Or, maybe there's a compound just under our noses, waiting to be found. One day, you might find oubli as a staple in your diet, or a similar fruit. Oubli lets us know that sweeteners can be formulated with purpose and intent, once the scientific key, the formula, to unlock the secret of sweetness reception is found. So, next time you visit your local cafe for a caffeine fix, remember that the colorful pink and blue packets of sweeteners are more than just happy accidents: they represent a new scientific frontier, full of possibilities and a sweeter future.

on-the-menu,The Goleta noodle ritual,27-Apr-23,10:00 AM,['Leo Safir'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-27/the-goleta-noodle-ritual/,"† Leo Safir / Daily Nexus Pho tonight?ù Shea asks. He sits in front of his laptop, painstakingly debugging his code.† Yeah, tonight's the night.ù We make eye contact and nod in unison. I text our housemate to ask if we can borrow her car. She gives us the ok, just as she does every week. I grab the spare key from its place in the porcelain bowl, Shea puts on his satin 49ers jacket and we step out into the evening. The black 4Runner is just down the block. I drive. I always drive. Shea says he doesn't want to be responsible for our lives.† Should I turn left or right?ù I ask as we rumble down Camino Pescadero. We hit Noodle City last week; let's do Saigon.ù I was thinking the same thing.ù† We pull into an expansive parking lot encircled by the glowing lights of storefronts. We pass by Target, its red logo staring down at us like an eye of a cyclops. Nestled in the corner of this vast strip mall is a hidden Vietnamese gem, Saigon Noodle House. It's one of two high-quality pho establishments within driving distance of Isla Vista. The other, Noodle City, is on Hollister Avenue. Why do you always put the parking brake on?ù Shea asks after I pull into a parking spot.† It's a reflex. It's from living in the city.ù I grew up in San Francisco, where parking on impossibly steep hills is routine. Besides offering a topographic challenge, the city is also a destination for incredible pho. I hardly feel like I've left home as we step into the bustling restaurant. We sit at the only table available. The waiter throws down two paper menus.† We know what we want,ù I say without opening the menu. Two number nines, large. And some ice water, please.ù† The soup comes quickly. The waiter emerges with a tray carrying our two steaming bowls and places them in front of us on the table. The rare steak slices turn from pink to gray in the broth. I pile my pho high with bean sprouts, jalape√±os and basil. The greens are fresh and aromatic. Shea squeezes a lime in his broth.† Why don't you add any Sriracha?ù he questions as he scoops chili into his soup.† I don't like to compromise the soup's integrity. The jalape√±os give me the spice without killing the flavor of the broth.ù† Trust me, the broth needs no altering. Both Saigon Noodle House and Noodle City have their recipes mastered. The beef broth incorporates star anise, which gives the pho its signature herbal flavor. While Noodle City's broth is slightly sweeter, the portions at Saigon make up for it, as they are more generous with their noodles. The noodles are incredible as well î they arrive in an entangled mass, but as you prod them with chopsticks they loosen and integrate into the broth. They are delicate yet chewy, providing a slippery bite to the soup. The price is reasonable too î each restaurant charges under $12 for a large. Luckily, neither Shea nor I is vegetarian, since all the soup offerings contain meat broth. However, for those who don't eat meat, Saigon has a special vegetarian menu displayed on a sign next to the door. Noodle City has an even larger selection, offering various combinations of broken rice plates, spring rolls and vermicelli bowls. While Shea and I stick to pho, there is no shortage of reasonably priced Vietnamese delicacies on both restaurants' menus.† We finish our soup and the waiter comes with the bill. It clatters on the table î Shea and I look each other up and down, questioning whose turn it is to pay.† I think it's my turn to get it,ù Shea says. He puts his card down. It's funny, I think, all the methods we have for orienting ourselves to time: days, weeks, holidays, parties, our quarter system. Currently, Shea and I are oriented to a weekly pho regimen and this bill signifies the conclusion of yet another round.† On the drive home, I can still taste the star anise and a hint of lime in my mouth. What I previously believed to be a San Francisco pho supremacy is being rightfully challenged by the hidden gems of Goleta.† A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the April 27, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,5 beginner bread recipes,4-May-23,10:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-04/5-beginner-bread-recipes/,"Bagels only undergo one proofing, meaning they rise once instead of twice. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus So you've mastered cookies and quick loaves, and now you feel that you're ready to try making your own bread. The world of breadmaking can be overwhelming for newbies, even those highly acquainted with baking desserts. First, there's yeast to contend with, then kneading, then proofing! But there is nothing more heavenly than opening your oven door to get a whiff of yeasty wonderfulness.† Where to start? Well, one of the perks of bread is that it hardly takes any ingredients. As long as you have flour, water, yeast and salt on hand, you can make dozens of bread variations. The most difficult ingredient is time î making bread can take the entire day split up into single steps over hours. While time-consuming, the steps are relatively easy for bakers of all skill levels. These five recipes are perfect for anyone ready to take their baking to the next level. French bread Mel's Kitchen Cafe is the blog home to my favorite French bread recipe. It's fluffy, delicious and can be made entirely by hand or with a kitchen mixer if desired. The mild flavor of French bread makes it incredibly versatile: I love using fresh-baked French bread for French toast, sandwiches and homemade croutons.† Bagels Sally's Baking Addiction baking blog is my trusted source for bagel recipes. Bagels are one of my favorite breads to make because they're delicious and taste much better fresh than the store-bought variety. What you might not know is that bagels only undergo one proofing, meaning that they rise once instead of twice. This key difference means that you can make bagels in less than two hours! Personally, my favorite bagel toppings are sesame seeds, shredded cheddar cheese and everything-bagel seasoning.†† Pizza dough My boyfriend and I use Sugar Spun Run's pizza dough recipe at least once a week. This blog recipe calls for garlic powder and Italian seasoning, making it the perfect base for savory toppings. Pizza dough, like bagels, only takes one rise. And if you've ever made homemade pizza, you know that it takes the cake over Domino's any day of the week. Get creative and turn homemade pizzas into date night! Or take a page out of Woodstock's book: Skip the savory seasonings and slather your dough with butter, cinnamon sugar and cream cheese frosting. Trust me, you won't regret it. Focaccia Focaccia is a great bread to convince others that you're a more experienced baker than you actually are. To most people's surprise, focaccia only takes one additional ingredient î olive oil î and doesn't even need to be kneaded. However, it can be dressed up with dozens of tasty mix-ins, like olives, scallions, rosemary and tomatoes. Bon App√©tit magazine's recipe is a great place to start. Cinnamon rolls Out of all the bread variations, I probably make cinnamon rolls the most, and Sally's Baking Recipes never fails. While cinnamon rolls are more complex than the first four breads listed above î they require an enriched doughù made with other ingredients such as milk, butter, eggs and sugar î they're so much better homemade than the kind sold in grocery stores.† No matter where you choose to start, I promise you'll be happy you did. After all, nothing tops freshly baked goods. Just make sure to hide them from your roommates î bagels hardly last 24 hours in my household. Or if you don't mind sharing, a homemade batch of cinnamon rolls will definitely impress everyone at brunch. You'll never want to buy premade bread again.

on-the-menu,Seaweed & Sriracha rice: In leftovers we trust,11-May-23,10:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-11/seaweed-sriracha-rice-in-leftovers-we-trust/,"Meiya Sidney / Daily Nexus The year of 2020 was a time for five-minute recipes, microwave mug cakes and easy, to-the-point recipes that require few ingredients and little time in order to create a robust, satisfying meal; people had bigger worries on their mind than their daily sustenance. As college students, we find ourselves dipping in and out of this mode of life, scarfing down scalding instant ramen and cold fries from Wingstop. We leave behind trash cans full of frozen food packaging with a paper and two quizzes due at 11:59 p.m. and no time to spare. On my busiest nights, I have found this seaweed and Sriracha rice recipe to provide the comfort and warmth I discovered in quarantine. As it goes for some beloved recipes, mine was both unintentional and unexpected, a successful dressing up of leftovers from the fridge. Nudged out of bed by my grumbling stomach at an ungodly hour, I found myself in the harsh glow of my fridge with just some takeout white rice. I warmed up the rice, threw in a mix of some dressings I found in the fridge door and added in the other half of a small pack of roasted seaweed that I had been snacking on. The rest is history. Below is the curated, latest version of my favorite, and only, recipe I've ever concocted.† † Seaweed & Sriracha Rice† Yield: 1 serving Time: 30 minutes Ingredients:† Directions:† † If any line from a Pixar movie has stuck with our generation, it's this one: Anyone can cookù î especially this recipe! As long as you aren't the one-in-a-million people who can somehow burn water, this recipe can be made with ease, little-to-no mess and right in your dorm! The ingredients also don't lend themselves to exorbitant pricing, and a simple trip to Trader Joe's should do the trick. Most importantly, this recipe itself is open to interpretation. You should make it your own: See what leftovers you may have, gather any different sauces or garnishes you particularly enjoy and try adding them together. You'll be surprised by what can dress up a rice-based dish as simple as this one. I recommend pulling out this recipe on an idle rainy day when you're stuck in the dorm with nothing to do but snuggle in a blanket and watch your favorite show. That's when I find it most delicious.† A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the May 11, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,"Kin Bakeshop, a Korean-inspired donut shop, is set to open in Goleta's Turnpike Shopping Center",11-May-23,10:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-11/kin-bakeshop-a-korean-inspired-donut-shop-is-set-to-open-in-goletas-turnpike-shopping-center/,"Tommy Chang and Will Chen spent years working together at a Los Angeles-based tech company, never expecting their professional relationship to evolve into the co-ownership of a wildly popular donut and beverage business.† During the onset of the pandemic, Chang, a Santa Barbara native, found himself in an all-too-common, unfortunate position: He was recently laid off from his job in tech, unemployed and somehow drawn to baking despite very little experience with the craft. He moved back to Santa Barbara, spending the aimless days of quarantine recipe testing and baking mochi donuts, a dessert by which he was fascinated with. There was little original intent to turn this pastime into a sellable product until Chang received some unexpected encouragement from his mother.† M≈çr's mochi donuts had a denser texture, featuring flavors such as Oreo. Photo courtesy of Tommy Chang. Being the oldest Asian son, and for your mom to say òHey, you should make donuts,' it's like you either failed in life or the donuts are actually pretty good. I think it was the latter,ù Chang said, chuckling as he recalled the early days of his baking journey.† Even with familial support, Chang had his doubts about selling his mochi donuts,†especially in Santa Barbara due to the area's somewhat lack of diversity of cuisines in comparison to larger cities like Los Angeles. Yet, at the same time, his unique mochi donut flavors garnered even more appeal for the business. He settled on the name M≈çr Doughnuts, thinking about what moreù he could do with his donuts by focusing on community connections and giving back to customers during the pandemic. M≈çr's first batch of donuts was sold in the form of a 50-donut, first-come, first-served giveaway along with gift cards to local coffee shops. From the start, the business was wildly successful and M≈çr's batches of donuts would sell out within minutes after Chang opened the website for online ordering.† As orders kept flowing in, Chang had to increase his output. Yet during this time, the kitchen space Chang was using to make his donuts was being demolished, and he needed to find a space that could accommodate a large commercial fryer in which to make M≈çr's signature mochi donut. This is the part of the story where Chang's former boss, Chen, steps in. Chen, also having very minimal baking experience, got to work developing a donut that would require less space to make than the mochi donuts Chang had been selling previously. By making use of his network of other chefs and restaurateurs for advice, Chen developed his own donut recipe î a hybrid between a traditional brioche donut and Japanese milk bread. Weeks of trial and error in the kitchen resulted in their very own brioche donut, one that had a better shelf life and was more moist and light. Once the brioche donut was perfected, Chang and Chen made their partnership official and rebranded the donut business with a new name: Kin Bakeshop.† Kin Bakeshop's name references Chang and Chen's friendship and everyone who helped the two carry their business to its current state. Honoring that kinship through the name change was a way for Chang to thank Chen, the Santa Barbara community and their loyal customers.† In the beginning, Kin Bakeshop's flavors were more basic: think strawberry, chocolate and vanilla. Now, Kin's donuts reference nostalgic flavors from the owners' childhoods and share these flavors with the Santa Barbara community. Tommy has this desire to share some of the flavors that are more nostalgic to him, flavors he grew up with and sharing different flavors that evoke memories in people,ù Chen said.† Chang began to think of flavors that would push the envelope and honor his heritage and the backgrounds of his closest friends and customers. This line of thinking resulted in donut filling flavors such as mango Taj√≠n and Okinawa milk tea. Through developing these flavors, Chang and Chen discovered that food is its own cultural language, a language that they're still learning. Kin Bakeshop's donuts are a hybrid between a traditional brioche donut and Japanese milk bread. Photo courtesy of Tommy Chang. A lot of the flavors come from the question, òWho am I as a Korean American?' What's the food in my culture beyond my mom? What's in Koreatown? What's in Korea? That curiosity seeped into everybody around me,ù Chang said. A local collaboration allowed Kin Bakeshop to hold regular pop-up shops in Santa Barbara and garner a passionate and regular customer base. It's no secret that outdoor pop-ups were one of the main ways to maintain a sense of community during the pandemic and for business owners to bond and connect with each other and their customers. Chang met Piti Sukavivatanachai, owner of Your Choice Restaurant on State Street, at a Bagel Boiz pop-up shop in Santa Barbara in 2020. After their introduction, Sukavivatanachai soon became a loyal customer of Kin Bakeshop, buying donuts at Kin's pop-ups and chatting with Chang and Chen. When Sukavivatanachai started a side project selling pints of his own Thai-inspired ice cream under the name Creaminal, he called on Chang's expertise in marketing and advertising to help with photography and branding for the business. Their professional relationship strengthened, leading Sukavivatanachai to generously offer up Your Choice Restaurant as the location for Kin's Saturday morning pop-ups.† On Saturday mornings starting as early as 8:30 a.m., a growing line would form around the back of Your Choice Restaurant, often wrapping around the perimeter of the restaurant. Locals would patiently wait for Chang and Chen to open the doors, having already thought about the donut flavors they'd choose thanks to a post on Kin's Instagram account announcing the donut and drink flavors of the day. At 10 a.m., the line slowly started moving, with customers catching glimpses of others in line before them carrying out pink boxes of fluffy donuts. A mere half hour later, Chang reluctantly poked his head out from the door, announcing they'd sold out. He apologized and thanked everyone for coming out. This series of events unfolded at every Kin Bakeshop pop-up.† Scaling up and moving the business to a storefront seemed like a natural progression after observing the success of the pop-ups at Your Choice Restaurant. Chang and Chen were approached about a space in Goleta's Turnpike Shopping Center, a location that held strong memories for Chang, who grew up picking pumpkins at Lane Farms just down the road. It encompassed this feeling of nostalgia and community. We decided that since we had been doing pop-ups and had a strong bond with the community and people loved our donuts, why don't we move to a permanent home?ù Chen said.† At the end of 2021, Chang and Chen signed the lease and started working to bring their vision to life, but not without working through several challenges. Construction delays pushed back their opening to spring 2023. Additionally, opening a donut shop during a recession meant relying on community support to help fund the opening. Chang and Chen launched a Kickstarter to raise the remaining amount of funds to finance the project. Their goal was $25,000 with a soft goal of $15,000. Unsurprisingly, the local community showed up for this small business as they had done numerous times and helped Kin raise $25,000 within just a few days.† The storefront will feature a simple, stripped-down design, drawing inspiration from Japanese and Korean minimalist architecture. Keeping the space open will free up space for future collaborations with other businesses, live musicians and other pop-ups, echoing Kin's early days as a pop-up at Your Choice Restaurant. Kin's menu will feature a few basic, permanent flavors as well as some rotating flavors; Chang and Chen hope customers will provide feedback on flavors they'd like to see. With Lighthouse Coffee as their neighbor in the Turnpike Shopping Center, Kin did not want to compete with the Santa Barbara-based coffee chain by offering drinks. Rather than crafting an entire menu of caf√© drinks, Kin will offer just a few signature drinks that their customers know and love from previous pop-ups: the Einspanner and Black Sesame Latte, two drinks with Asian flavors in line with Kin's identity.† Chang is still in disbelief that what started as a humble donut business out of his home kitchen was able to blossom into a successful, local pop-up shop and now a storefront. He attributes the kindness and compassion cultivated during the very beginning of his business î through M≈çr's free donut giveaways and coffee shop gift cards as well as encouraging customers to write kind notes upon purchasing î to the growth of a customer base that also exudes the same level of kindness. Community support and appreciation truly served as the backbone of this business.† Will and I are so grateful. It has always been about people and not about the donuts,ù Chang said.

on-the-menu,"Modern Jewish Baker: Challah, Babka, Bagels & Moreù: The bread lover's best friend",18-May-23,10:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-18/modern-jewish-baker-challah-babka-bagels-more-the-bread-lovers-best-friend/,"The cookbook's cookie options include rugelach and hamantaschen. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus A little over a year ago, I found myself desperately typing chocolate bread recipesù into the Google search bar. As an admitted chocolate fanatic with a knack for making bread, I felt like there simply had to be a recipe out there that was missing from my baking repertoire. Thankfully, chocolate babka filled that void. Not even a minute after I came across a picture of a braided babka loaf with a decadent chocolate cinnamon filling, I was already pulling out my flour. That first month, I must have baked at least three loaves. But I didn't stop with babka î next, I learned about rugelach, and the month after that, I tackled bagels. Thus began my obsession with Jewish baked goods. But it wasn't until recently that I picked up Modern Jewish Baker: Challah, Babka, Bagels & Moreù by Shannon Sarna, which features a complete collection of traditional and modern Jewish recipes. Sarna attributes her inspiration to her uniquely mixed Italian-Jewish heritage. In the cookbook's introduction, she explains that she sees traditional Jewish baked goods as an invitation to merge old and new in creatively diverse ways. The result? Bakeable heaven. The modern aesthetic of Sarna's cookbook perfectly reflects the simplistic beauty of the recipes inside. The front cover, featuring three beautiful babka loves on a dark surface, immediately caught my attention and set the tone for the rest of the pages. Nearly every recipe is accompanied by a mouthwatering photo, making them all the more enticing and easy to follow.† Sarna carries that theme of simplicity through the book's organization as well. The recipes are neatly divided into seven distinct sections: challah, babka, bagels, rugelach, hamantaschen, matzah and pita bread. Each section begins with a foundational recipe, followed by a handful of innovative flavor combinations, such as balsamic apple date stuffed challah, spicy pizza rugelach and coconut cheesecake hamantaschen.† In celebration of Jewish American Heritage Month, I set off to replicate as many recipes as I could before my housemates literally grew sick of bread and cookies.† I decided to start with challah. I'd made plain challah before î a white enriched bread that tastes similar to brioche î but I'd never tried adding mix-ins before. Thinking I'd begin with something simple, I chose to make the cinnamon raisin challah. Or, I would have, if I had any raisins on hand. Following Sarna's recommendation, I used chocolate chips instead. Quite honestly, I'm convinced the recipe should permanently include chocolate chips because it was delicious. Sweet, chewy and with the perfect amount of spice, this loaf was an immediate hit in my house. The next morning, I followed Sarna's fantastic advice and turned the remaining slices into French toast. There's nothing quite like dessert for breakfast to motivate you out of bed in the morning.† This Cinnamon Raisin Challah bread recipe can be found on page 61. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Next up, I tackled Sarna's raspberry chocolate rugelach (are you seeing the chocolate theme yet?). If you've never heard of rugelach, let me put you on: it's pastry dough made with part cream cheese and part butter that is rolled up around a sweet or savory filling. Flakier than a shortbread cookie yet denser than croissant-style pastry, rugelach is the perfect middle child. I am not exaggerating when I say that these jammy chocolate cookies were one of the most delicious desserts I've baked in years. The tart and sweet raspberry jam balanced the bitter dark chocolate like a dream. However, be warned: you should use less jam per cookie than you think! I filled each rugelach with the suggested 3 teaspoons of jam, and most of it ended up erupting out the sides and burning onto my sheet pan. While they may not have turned out as the most aesthetically pleasing cookies, trust me, they're worth your time. And remember, there's nothing a heavy sprinkle of powdered sugar can't fix. Last, because I decided that I probably should try a savory recipe for a properly balanced review, I whipped up a loaf of Sarna's savory babka. Babka is another braided white bread that is usually served with a cinnamon filling and syrup. But unlike challah, which includes eggs and oil, babka dough contains eggs, butter and milk, making it more airy, shiny and smooth. Per the recipe's suggestion, I also included a savory filling of pesto and shredded parmesan cheese, which really elevated the simple bread. The end result was garlic bread's classier, more intricate older cousin.† Modern Jewish Baker: Challah, Babka, Bagels & Moreù truly opened my eyes to a world of new flavor combinations that I normally wouldn't have considered. Her unique recipes push the boundaries of tradition in all the best ways. The only thing I would warn you about is Sarna's chosen portions. Each bread recipe yields three loaves and each cookie recipe yields over two dozen cookies; if you aren't planning to bake for a small army, have your calculator on hand. Overall, I highly recommend Modern Jewish Baker: Challah, Babka, Bagels & Moreù for anyone interested in expanding their baking portfolio.

on-the-menu,"A beloved, family-owned gem of Isla Vista: Roger's Tacos",18-May-23,10:00 AM,['Isabel Hiestand'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-18/a-beloved-family-owned-gem-of-isla-vista-rogers-tacos/,"Roger's Tacos sets up their tent in the backyards of homes for pop-ups and fundraisers for student organizations. Shiuan Cheng / Daily Nexus† Walking down Del Playa Drive on one of its quieter nights is one of my favorite things to do. People bike by, the sunset is harnessed in the beautiful sky, the waves rumble on the beach and the birds sing ¶ What more can one ask for? While on my routine hot-girl walk, I was greeted by a familiar, welcoming scent. Seeping into the air in front of me was the beautiful aroma of Roger's Tacos, set up in the driveway of a house one block over.† Roger's Tacos has been setting up its grill and tables under a tent in the driveways of several homes in Isla Vista since 2019, bringing their intensely delicious food to the Isla Vista community. However, their story did not start with the pop-ups that Isla Vista has grown to love. Owners Mac and Rogelio Ochoa says the operation started as a happy accident after a friend's graduation party.† There was leftover meat,ù and following some advertising to the Isla Vista community on Instagram they started selling and a lot of people gathered and asked when [they] were going to return.ù† Following their debut, Ochoa says the business received a lot of support from students in the community. A student made our Instagram and then another five students made òRoger's Tacos' logos; then a student made us the price menu,ù Ochoa said.† Since that fateful day in 2019, their popularity has exploded. The number of pop-ups have been increasing rapidly, as clubs and organizations invite them to cater for fundraising efforts.. During my recent visit, the line reached almost to the end of the block and grew as unsuspecting passersby and intentional patrons joined. The nearly hour-long wait was well worth it.† Roger's Tacos choices of meats include al pastor (pictured), chicken, vegetarian options and several more, meaning there is something for everyone. Shiuan Cheng / Daily Nexus Finally reaching the front of the line, I ordered from their menu options of tacos, burritos, mulitas, quesadillas and side dishes including rice and beans. The choice of a burrito, quesadilla, and mulitas allows for you to also choose add ons ranging from rice, cheese and beans along with your choice of protein. There is no wrong choice. Their choices of meats include al pastor, chicken, vegetarian options and several more, meaning there is something for everyone. Each protein is incredibly well flavored and has excellent consistency. The chef recommends the al pastor, which is arguably life-changing. Receiving your order straight from the grill is not the end of the journey î don't forget to add sauces and toppings. They have a choice of three salsas, cucumbers, onions, cilantro and limes that you can add to your dish. If you order a burrito, they'll wrap it up for you after you add your desired toppings. If you want to be a full-fledged patron of Roger's Tacos, order a sweet, creamy horchata to accompany your meal.† Roger's Tacos has grown from Isla Vista's little secret into a full-blown cult classic. Ochoa says she does not have any concrete plans for the future of Roger's Tacos and only wants to continue supporting the students of Isla Vista. So, if you want to plan a fundraiser, try someplace new or simply support a small business with amazing food, check out the gem of Isla Vista: Roger's Tacos.† Follow @rogerstacos on Instagram for information about their next pop-up!

Night Market,25-May-23,10:00 AM,"['Abigail Monti', 'Stephanie Gerson']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-25/evpla-hosts-i-v-night-market/,"Local bands Ray and Paul Holmberg and Cordoba perform at the Night Market. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs hosted the Isla Vista Night Market on May 18, where student vendors and local restaurants sold art, jewelry, clothing and concessions. Staged at Little Acorn Park, the evening event that celebrated both emerging and well-loved businesses was open to the public. Live music from local bands Ray and Paul Holmberg and Cordoba, paired with the smells of fired-up grills, attracted a large student turnout. Tri-Tip Thursdays serve steak sandwiches. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Ironically, for a town utterly devoid of brick-and-mortar barbeque establishments, the I.V. Night Market's food selection was dominated by grilled meat offerings. Tri-Tip Thursdays, a beloved pop-up established in fall quarter by three UCSB sophomores, was a hit among event attendees. Their classic tri-tip steak sandwiches were served in freshly toasted hoagie buns and came with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch dressing for the reasonable price of $8. According to Nick Storch, the business visionary with a background in competitive barbeque, the mission of Tri-Tip Thursdays is to provide high-quality food for cheap prices so less college students go hungry.ù Interested parties can find their weekly pop-up shop at 6518 El Nido Lane, which boasts a larger menu of tri-tip fries, funnel cakes and ice cream. In addition to Tri-Tip Thursdays' steak sandwiches, barbeque lovers could also order from local business Promeatheus BBQ, which hosted a table boasting an expansive menu of brisket, macaroni and cheese, chicken drumsticks and more. The Western Hot Dog from Dave's Dog features grilled onions, bacon and BBQ sauce. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Meat lovers also had the option of ordering hot dogs, chicken tenders and an assortment of fried foods from the Dave's Dogs food truck. Listed as No. 6 on Yelp's top 10 list of best wieners in 2017, the Santa Barbara local restaurant reimagines the American staple with creative toppings, such as pastrami, jalapenos, macaroni and cheese, avocado, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, grilled pineapple and more. Dave's Dogs Grill's permanent location is on Turnpike Road in Santa Barbara. In addition to crafting gourmet hot dogs, in February, owner Dave Reynoso recently opened Dave's Drip House, an ice cream and dessert shop in Goleta's Turnpike Shopping Center.† For the duration of the event, a sizable line persisted outside of Elubia's Kitchen, a Latin American food truck. The food truck is known for pupusas, Mexican street tacos and an assortment of Guatemalan dishes such as dobladitas, pan-fried corn tortillas filled with chicken and potato. Elubia's Kitchen frequently pops up at events in Isla Vista, but fans of Latin American food can also visit their restaurant in Goleta.† Meals of Olympus showcases their premade meals at their table. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Neuxs Tri-Tip Thursdays wasn't the only student-run food business at the night market. Meals of Olympus, a subscription food service with a focus on Mediterranean cuisine, showcased their premade meal kits at their table. Meals of Olympus was founded by childhood friends Sahag Bilamjian and UCSB fourth-year Hakop Feroyan who are committed to offering healthy, fresh meals to those in the greater Los Angeles area.† To accompany the many savory food options, student-run baked goods business Zaira's Delights sold creative confections like churro cheesecake while other tables offered cups of Thai iced tea and homemade horchata. Many attendees left the night market with a satisfying meal, a handcrafted purchase from student-owned small businesses, a beverage in hand and a smile.† A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the May 24, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Lemon Cheesecake for Shavuot,25-May-23,10:00 AM,['Joey Sable'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-25/lemon-cheesecake-let-them-eat-cake/,"Three kinds of soft cheeses and a generous amount of lemon juice and zest make this cheesecake incredibly tart and decadent. Joey Sable / Daily Nexus Jewish food is all-encompassing and expansive, transcending regional boundaries by somehow still maintaining and simultaneously hybridizing Jewish tastes with other cuisines and cultures. My grandparents were children of immigrants from the Russian Empire at the initiation of the Russian Revolution, so the recipes and tastes that ruminate during familial events or religious holidays are all very reminiscent of what was accessible to them regionally. Potatoes and onions are prevalent in main and side dishes, with potato kugel and cholent being the centerpiece of the meal on Shabbat and respective holidays. Slow-cooked stews and dishes like brisket and cholent evoke nostalgia of the old world of Eastern European Jewry, in line with cooking constraints outlined on Shabbat, while containing staple crops and cheaper cuts of meat. Bagels, pickled vegetables and fish are also centerpieces at family gatherings î indicative of the tastes consumed in the old world and transmitted through Jewish immigration to the United States.† Meat is exclusively consumed on Jewish holidays, with the exception of the upcoming holiday of Shavuot in which meat is forbidden from consumption. Specific to the holiday and regardless of one's Ashkenazi or Sephardic origins, cheesecake in different iterations and forms finds its way onto the tables of Jews globally. In popular narratives, Shavuot is known as the Jewish holiday in which Moses ascended from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments, but is important in its emphasis on pilgrimage and wheat harvest. There isn't one definite answer to the question of why Jews eat cheesecake and dairy on Shavuot, but it is speculated that the rules of kashrut, kosher dietary laws, for meat were not established yet, permitting the Jewish people to instead consume dairy.† Based on Alison Roman's Citrusy Cheesecake published in the New York Times, this cheesecake recipe is more tart and custard-like and relinquishes all the strenuous steps traditionally associated with baking cheesecake. Given the fact that I intentionally queer all of my Jewish recipes, I couldn't make a simple or conventional cheesecake. I used three kinds of soft cheeses and a generous amount of lemon juice and zest to make it incredibly tart and decadent, not too sweet but perfectly palatable for anyone.

on-the-menu,Food for thought: senior reflections,1-Jun-23,10:02 AM,['Katherine McCabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-01/food-for-thought-senior-reflections/,"Senior Katherine McCabe cooks in her IV kitchen. Katherine McCabe / Daily Nexus There's a beauty about food and writing about food that feels quietly understated. It's something so simple, so innocuous, so everyday î and I think that's what's part of the appeal to me. It offers reprieve from weightier subjects, to get to revel in something so uncomplicated and community-oriented. Writing for On the Menu has been a joy and an aspect of my college experience that I will miss greatly. I think a large part of this is because it has been such an extension of so many other of my experiences here î my friends and I had a delightful Friendsgivingù together, and I got to commemorate the multitude of experiences we lived through that night in the form of an article. The clink of our glasses, the smell of roasted garlic, the laughs we shared in between bites can be reduced down into a collection of recipes, shared with the world now, made ready for someone else to experience with different friends in a different room with different silverware. For all its variability, through cultures and techniques, recipe substitutions and rookie chef mistakes î the defining constant in cooking is this simple kind of love. Sharing a meal together is, to me, a celebration of friendships, family, culture and history. And we get to do it every day!† This is what I've loved so much about writing for On the Menu, and getting the privilege of reading all of the other published articles as well. For something so simple, food and people's experiences with it are highly unique. There is so much to learn about food and so much to share as well; On the Menu provides a student-based medium for doing that. On the Menu helped me pick a restaurant to go to when my mom visited town (we went to The Blue Owl, by the way, and it was delicious); it also taught me what fonio is (the answer: a West African grain with a pleasant fluffy texture that offers a sustainable alternative to conventional grain farming). Other writers at On the Menu shared the best vegan cheeses at the I.V. Food Co-op, an incredible recipe for fried green tomatoes and a surprisingly emotional essay about ratatouille. Each one of these articles has moved and impacted me, from the more benign decision of buying vegan cheese to reflecting on the value of friendship; each story, experience and flavor shared has mattered. For me personally, On the Menu has been an invaluable outlet for everything from sharing my favorite cookie recipe to addressing the relationship between our food system and climate change to honoring and remembering my father who has passed on. Food is whatever you want it to be; that's what makes it so special. It's simple, fun and silly. It's quick and easy or it's a labor of love. It's the glue between family and culture. It's what keeps us alive, both as sustenance for the body and the spirit.† I guess that's sort of the kicker then. I keep referring to food as simple, and I really think that it is or that it should be. Yet at the same time, it's a subject that is so nuanced and complicated. As an environmental studies major, I've primarily focused my studies and research on food systems and regenerative agriculture. This is a field of study that has brought me both great despair and unparalleled hope. The way conventional agriculture is practiced both in the U.S. and globally is reckless and harmful to our ecosystems, watersheds, climate and ourselves. Comparably harmful is the way food production and distribution are handled once crops are grown: there are countless disparities in access to healthy and fresh food. Cultural foods are often made inaccessible or shamed or ignored in the larger media. In my first year as an environmental studies major, I was quite disillusioned with the practice of agriculture, which, as I had learned it, pretty much exclusively caused harm to our planet. However, regenerative farming actually has an untapped potential to do great things, from restoring topsoil to sequestering carbon to vastly improving the health and nutrition of those who participate in our food system. I see food not just as a pedestrian, everyday activity but as a point of origin for a better future. Food is an opportunity to heal our planet and ecosystems. It's an invaluable nexus of family, culture and identity. It's a way to take agency over our health and well-being. It's my favorite way to express my love for someone. In my time writing for On the Menu, I've sincerely valued the opportunity to share my recipes and words and feel honored and humbled to have read about so many incredible meals and stories. I will miss it dearly. A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the June 1, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,"Letter from the Editor: Community, food and the Nexus",1-Jun-23,10:08 AM,['Chace Duma'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-01/letter-from-the-editor-community-food-and-the-nexus/,"Maddy Fangio / Daily Nexus I love when life's biggest developments hinge on the smallest of coincidences. In 2019, somewhere, somehow, I found a sticker with an alien skateboarding over the word Nexustentialism.ù It was the spring quarter of my freshman year and one of my darker times at UCSB; I was wandering listlessly around questions of the future, I was unpassionate, uninspired and unwell, self-medicating my then undiagnosed depression by steeping my brain in ungodly amounts of Phoebe Bridgers. I picked up the sticker simply because it made me laugh. I brought it back to my dorm and googled Nexustentialism UCSB.ù† Thus began my first Nexus experience, as a writer with Nexustentialism (now The Daily Stench). It was terrifying. I was in awe of (and a little bit in love with) Emma and Max, the editors at the time. They're some of the kindest, funniest people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. There is nothing like telling a joke in a room full of funny people, some of whom you admire, and having it HIT. An incomparable high! There's also nothing like telling a joke in a room full of people you want desperately to impress and having it flop. Mortifying! Both incredibly important though. Nexustentialism helped me grow a lot as a person and as a writer. It made me bolder and funnier and most importantly, it gave me direction! I felt a strong sense of community with the other Stench writers, something I'd been missing at UCSB. I loved to write, I loved these people and I loved the newspaper; it felt like home.† A few months later, I moved into an apartment of my own, which meant a kitchen of my own, and started to explore my passion for food. Food, the ritual of mealtime, and the absolute pleasure in eating something delicious are constant and important over the entirety of my life. Get a glass of wine and a good meal in me and I'll start waxing poetic about how this! right! here! is the meaning of life. Food and community! Two inseparable threads throughout my 23 years. My mom cooked nearly every night, and family dinnerù was tradition. In high school, my friends and I cooked together all the time (we referred to ourselves as the chef boizù), emulating our favorite chefs (mainly just Roy Choi) and putting on massive feasts for each other. Food has always meant love, laughter, pleasure and absolute joy to me.† So, when I discovered On The Menu, I jumped at the chance to combine my passions for writing and food. Shortly after publishing my first couple articles, I applied and (miraculously) was hired as assistant editor! Joining the Daily Nexus Editorial Staff was a dream of mine (mainly because I wanted to be like Emma and Max), and it felt right to do so as the food section editor. The rest, I suppose, is history? Something like that. The past three years I've spent on Editorial Staff have been truly wonderful; some of my favorite moments at UCSB happened in our musty, crusty, dusty office. Walking into that room always felt like coming home, in a way; to spend hours surrounded by people I love, joking around, laughing, and creating something beautiful is a blessing I do not take for granted! The Nexus is such a special environment, and I thank freshman Chace for stealing that Stench sticker way back in 2019.† It's getting misty in here! I want to say thank you to Emma Demorest, Max Myszkowski, Winnie Lam, Michelle Lee, Stephanie Gerson, Atmika Iyer, Sierra Vakili and all of my wonderful writers for making my time at the Nexus so fulfilling. It wouldn't have been the same without y'all <3.†  A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the June 1, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Celebratory spicy margaritas,1-Jun-23,10:15 AM,['Sophie Lynd'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-01/celebratory-spicy-margaritas/,"Katya Kiseleva / Daily Nexus To me, summer tastes like a cold, spicy margarita on a sunny day. With summer î and graduation î just around the corner, this recipe is the perfect way to celebrate, whether it be passing that super gnarly class or, if you're a senior like me, toasting with your roommates as the sun goes down on your final few nights of college. As students with limited time and money, it may be tempting to buy canned cocktails or a premade mix, but I encourage you to take the time to prepare and assemble these delicious cocktails as you reflect on the end of the school year and all of your accomplishments. The ingredients are pretty simple and, not to mention, the lack of artificial sugars is sure to lessen your hangover. Luckily for me, my dad is a professional chef who can pull any recipe for any food or drink I might want right out of his pocket. So instead of asking Google, I ask my dad and I can count that whatever the result is, it will be delicious.† Here's my dad's spicy margarita recipe, with a few adjustments to make it a little bit more college apartment friendly. Yield: 1 drink Time: 7-10 minutes Ingredients: Directions: The great thing about this drink is how customizable it can be. If you like a little less spice, use jalepe√±os and cover the rim in salt instead of Taj√≠n. If you like more spice, you can leave the chile slices in your cup! And if you don't have a cocktail shaker, these drinks can taste just as good by giving the ingredients a good stir in a cup of ice.† My dad stands by the belief that food and drink bring people together, and the better the food, the better time everyone has.. As for this particular drink, I'll be sharing it with my family and friends alongside a homemade taco bar to celebrate graduation. Happy almost summertime, Gauchos. And to the class of 2023, happy graduation! A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the June 1, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

I would go to the store to grab some chicken nuggets here and some buffalo chicken dip there î enough to snack on but never actually cook something. Now I have some staple meals that I love to make, and I only need to make one stop at my favorite store: Trader Joe's. I am going to share three of my favorite meals using Trader Joe's products that have no significant prep or cook time for anyone who might be struggling with what to make. First, the go-to dish that started my Trader Joe's fixation: fish tacos. I developed an addiction to the tangy Trader Joe's Peri-Peri sauce and was trying to find what best to pair it with, and I landed on these easy tacos. They are nothing fancy, but even in their simplicity, they are delicious.† These tacos feature Trader Joe's Peri-Peri Sauce and Battered Halibut. Anya Kennelly / Daily Nexus Fish Tacos Yield: 3 tacos Time: 15 minutes Ingredients: Directions: My next meal recommendation is an ode to the vodka sauce from my favorite restaurant in my hometown. I tried to recreate it, and while it's not the exact same dish, I ended up loving it. While Trader Joe's sauce doesn't compare to the homemade variety, it's pretty tasty and definitely makes this meal extremely efficient to prepare.† Chicken Pasta with Vodka Sauce† Yield: 2 bowls of pasta Time: 20 minutes Ingredients: Directions: This third meal is something that I have been fixated on as of late and frequently make for a quick lunch. Originally, my mom introduced me to the Trader Joe's gyro. I wanted something easy to carry with me on campus to snack on in between classes, so I decided to make a sandwich out of it and incorporate some of my other Trader Joe's favorites like their tzatziki dip!† Gyro Sandwich Yield: 1 sandwich† Time: 10 minutes Ingredients: Directions: These three recipes are relatively low cost and perfect for any mood. Sometimes I add other ingredients to change it up, but I find that these recipes are the ultimate guide to easy college cooking, especially after a long day of classes. I hope these meals can be of use to anyone struggling to find quick meals to make and, like me, have an ever-growing addiction to Trader Joe's!

on-the-menu,Augie's of Santa Barbara: fine Mexican dining in the heart of downtown,15-Jun-23,10:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-15/augies-of-santa-barbara-fine-mexican-dining-in-the-heart-of-downtown/,"Anytime my family visits me in Santa Barbara from the Bay Area, I'm tasked with securing a dinner reservation for a restaurant that truly encapsulates Santa Barbara cuisine. What comes to mind when I try to define the cuisine of this area are locally sourced seafood, fresh ingredients, great drinks and a strong Mexican influence.† Augie's, located on the corner of State Street and E Ortega Street, opened in October of 2022 with all of these hallmarks of Santa Barbara restaurant culture in mind. The restaurant's menu was created by chef Eduardo Gonzalez, a Santa Barbara native who was raised in Guadalajara. Gonzalez told the Santa Barbara Independent that he wanted to introduce elevated Mexican cuisine to the area, as most Santa Barbara residents limit their consumption of Mexican food to burritos, tacos and other quick bites.† Diners can choose to enjoy their meal outside on Augie's bright and airy patio or inside among the restaurant's expansive spirit selection and full-service bar. Augie's places a strong emphasis on its drinks menu and invites diners to explore its collection of tequila, mescal and other Latin American spirits through curated tasting flights.† The Punta Mita margarita features blanco tequila, lime and housemade mango-habanero syrup. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus As someone who turned 21 a mere six months ago, I feel under qualified to judge Augie's drink selection and award their Punta Mita the title of the best margarita I've ever had, but I'm going to anyway. The Punta Mita features blanco tequila, lime and housemade mango-habanero syrup and is garnished with mango con chile and a half-salted rim. Unlike most of the other margaritas I've consumed, I truly felt like Augie's perfected the ratio of sweetness, spice and full-bodied flavor with the Punta Mita. Plus, I'm a sucker for beautifully presented drinks.† Augie's sources ingredients for its elevated Mexican dishes locally from the Santa Barbara deep water channel fishery and Santa Barbara farmers markets, which explains the higher price points of the menu items. But trust me, you can taste the difference when restaurants emphasize local ingredients. Chef Gonzalez encourages people to order several dishes and enjoy their meal family style, starting with one of the fish- and vegetable-centered appetizers then trying one of the tacos or empanadas before diving into a meat-based entree.† Starters include the Tuna Aguachile, a fusion of Hawaiian poke and Latin American ceviche. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Following the chef's recommendation, we began our meal with the Tuna Aguachile, a fusion of Hawaiian poke and Latin American ceviche, complete with ahi tuna, cucumber, onion, radish, cilantro, habanero and Augie's tangy black sauce. With plantain chips as our vessel for the chunks of ahi, we absolutely devoured the aguachile. This light and refreshing starter graciously donates $2 to the Latino Community Foundation with every order. Next, we enjoyed a trio of the Baja Tacos consisting of fried shrimp drizzled with jalape√±o aioli before diving into our main courses. I was very hesitant to order the Empanadas de Mariscos, a duo of blue corn empanadas filled with lobster, shrimp and oaxaca cheese, but I'm glad that I stepped outside of my comfort zone because this unexpected combination was surprisingly delicious and satisfying.† Filled with lobster, shrimp and oaxaca cheese, the Empanadas de Mariscos spotlight Santa Barbara's freshest catch. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus We ended our meal on a sweet note by sharing the Coco Loco dessert. Once again, Augie's presentation wowed us. The Coco Loco is served on a bed of corn kernels in a hollowed coconut shell, filled with rich, coconut ice cream layered atop chocolate pearls and pineapple pieces which are buried underneath; it was divine.† I was thoroughly impressed with the creative methods in which the restaurant highlighted Santa Barbara's local catch and allowed the freshness of each ingredient to shine without overwhelming each dish with additional sauces and accouterments. Securing a reservation at Augie's has become increasingly challenging, as the restaurant has become a popular fine dining staple on State Street in recent months. However, if you are looking for an establishment to honor the school year coming to a close, consider Augie's as the perfect venue for such a celebration!†

on-the-menu,I.V. Pizza Pub: the hidden gem of the Isla Vista breakfast scene,22-Jun-23,9:11 PM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-22/i-v-pizza-pub-the-hidden-gem-of-the-isla-vista-breakfast-scene/,"I.V. Pizza Pub's NYC Breakfast Pizza comes topped with scrambled eggs, green bell peppers, onions, Canadian bacon and mushrooms. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Following an announcement on their Instagram last month, I.V. Pizza Pub began serving brunch from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday. As Isla Vista has few breakfast options and even fewer brunch options, I.V. Pizza Pub is a welcomed addition to the market.† Under the same management as I.V. Bagel Cafe î which sees a long line of hungry college students queue up for hangover-curing bagels each weekend î I.V. Pizza Pub offers many of the same bagel varieties available at I.V. Bagel Cafe and even uses the same rewards program. The similar menu and slightly offset hours hopefully suggest that the incredibly long line of I.V. Bagel Cafe may be alleviated in the future. I.V. Pizza Pub's menu includes a selection of classic bagel sandwiches, bagel melts and flavored cream cheese bagels. However, prospective customers should note that the bagel choices are slightly more limited than the expansive selection of I.V. Bagel Cafe: IV Pizza Pub only offers plain, sesame, galaxy or cinnamon glaze bagels.† Yet, I.V. Pizza Pub's brunch menu makes up for this loss through other creative additions. I.V. Pizza Pub boasts four unique pizza combinations served on toasted bagels. In addition to traditional cheese and pepperoni, customers can also enjoy two popular combinations from the night-time pizza menu: the Big Sur and Manresa. The Big Sur, which comes loaded with roasted garlic, red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, portobello mushrooms, herbs and green onions, has even won awards from both the West Coast U.S. Pizza Cup and World Pizza Games. I chose to order a Manresa pizza bagel, which came generously topped with sliced Roma tomatoes, spoonfuls of ricotta cheese and freshly shredded basil. For thick-crust pizza fans like me, I thoroughly enjoyed this bagel-pizza hybrid.† In addition, I.V. Pizza Pub's menu now includes the unique offering of the NYC Breakfast Pizza. Personally, I have walked past 7-Eleven's crusty advertisements for breakfast pizza enough times to feel as adverse to the concept as I do to those eternally rolling hot dogs. But I.V. Pizza Pub presents a delicious product way out of 7-Eleven's league: aesthetic slices of thin-crust pizza dough topped with a thin layer of scrambled eggs, chunks of Canadian bacon, mushrooms, onions, mozzarella cheese and green bell pepper. Sold for $7 per slice, I.V. Pizza Pub's breakfast pizza retails for a few bucks higher than most of their other slices. However, the novelty of the idea might just make up for the raised price. I.V. Pizza Pub also caters to those who enjoy continuing alcoholic festivities through the morning. Their brunch menu includes both traditional orange juice mimosas and blueberry limosas. The latter contains a tantalizing combination of homemade blueberry syrup, lemonade and prosecco. This fall, transform your Sunday morning football routine with a sparkling glass in one hand and a bagel sandwich in the other. After all, I.V. Pizza Pub's new massive flatscreen televisions practically feel like front row seats. Between their expansive menu and ideal location, I.V. Pizza Pub is the perfect brunch destination for all those mid-afternoon risers who are too lazy to make breakfast and just energetic enough to walk down the street. Though I.V. Pizza Pub's brunch is still a little-known secret, I predict it will soon become another Isla Vista breakfast classic.

on-the-menu,Summertime beef patties: taking new twists on an American classic,4-Jul-23,10:45 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-04/summertime-beef-patties-taking-new-twists-on-an-american-classic/,"The combination of white cheddar, bacon and grilled onions never disappoints. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus There's nothing more quintessentially American than a barbeque dinner on a hot summer evening. Something about grilled meats (and even veggies) slathered in sauce and served between a bun evokes a weird and inescapable rush of patriotism. Between hot dogs, steak, ribs, sausages, corn and skewers, there is no shortage of options. But my personal grilled go-to is and always will be burgers.† According to IBISWorld, an industry market research database, as of March 2023 there are nearly 92,000 burger restaurants in the U.S. Most of them probably claim that their burger recipe or unique topping combination is the best in the nation. Though it's impossible to truly declare one recipe's superiority, certain characteristics definitely elevate some burgers over others. My mom's classic beef patty recipe, for one, definitely checks all the right boxes. It might not be nationally ranked, but trust me when I say that her recipe encapsulates everything you want in a burger: thick, juicy and full of flavor.† The key ingredient is minced onion. Most burger recipes call for powdered onion, but grilling actual onion morsels straight into the patty imbues your burger with a savory flavor unlike any other. Otherwise, it's a relatively straightforward recipe with only a couple of main ingredients and traditional seasoning. These burgers can either be cooked outside on the grill or inside on a griddle, making them perfect for both regular hot days and you-couldn't-pay-me-to-leave-an-air-conditioned-room hot days. But everyone knows that oftentimes, a quality patty isn't enough to make a truly mouthwatering burger; toppings are just as important to create that perfect bite. Sure, you can't go wrong with the classic combo of lettuce and tomato, but I recommend spicing things up with more untraditional add-ons. Here are some of my favorite topping combinations: And, of course, bun selection is equally important. I typically gravitate towards a traditional sesame-topped white bun or a golden brioche bun, but I've also had delicious success with Hawaiian buns and toasted sourdough bread. But back to the important part: the patty itself. Mom's simple recipe will ensure that no matter what bread or toppings you choose, your burger will taste like red white and blue heaven. Classic beef patties Yield: 8 patties Time: 25 minutes Ingredients: Directions: To make your meal extra patriotic, pair your burger with sides like macaroni salad, grilled corn on the cob, sliced watermelon, onion rings and thick slices of apple pie. Happy Fourth of July!

Anya Kennelly / Daily Nexus When I was younger, my mom decided to move our family from California to a tiny town in the west of France ì much to my sister and I's shock since none of us spoke French. Nonetheless, after a couple of French lessons, we were whisked away to the land of the Eiffel Tower and baguettes. We thought we might be moving to Paris, full of glamorous fashion, but our magical trip landed us in the middle of the countryside in a village with less than a thousand people. We had to learn a new language and adapt to a new culture, but the holy grail of the nerve-wracking first few months was food, as we were not used to living somewhere where the nearest grocery store was a 20-minute drive away. There were so many sweets to try, but none so enticing as the cr√™pes that our friend made for us. The cr√™pes were incredible because not only did we move to France, where delicious pastries were abundant, but we moved to the birthplace of cr√™pes: Brittany. Cr√™pes became our go-to. Every snack time or sweet craving was answered with this deliciously simple treat.†† Bastille Day is France's national holiday, commemorating the day that helped start a revolution for independence. Much like the Fourth of July in the United States, France has blue, white and red festivities full of summer activities and fireworks. The town of Brittany threw a big party along the river with games and food, ranging from potato sack races to the local bar cart. Every 14th of July, my sister and I would stuff our faces with galettes and cr√™pes. So now, while we may not have the potato sack races in the French countryside, my family makes cr√™pes as a part of our Bastille Day celebration. We use the same recipe that our family friend graciously gave us in those early days of adapting to French life, and have always found the outcome delicious.† Time: 15 minutes Yield: 25 cr√™pes Ingredients: Directions: If you don't want to eat them all at once, no worries. You can either store the batter in the fridge, or make all of your cr√™pes and store them in the fridge for up to a week! These cr√™pes are the perfect celebration for any occasion, but especially for this special French holiday!

on-the-menu,"Post-pandemic Obon festivals bring Japanese culture, food and celebration to communities",20-Jul-23,10:12 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-20/post-pandemic-obon-festivals-bring-japanese-culture-food-and-celebration-to-communities/,"Festival attendees participated in bon odori, a Japanese folk dance traditionally performed on Obon. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus 
For over 500 years, Japanese culture has celebrated the annual Buddhist holiday of Obon („ÅäÁõÜ). During the traditionally three-day event, participants honor their ancestors, whose spirits are believed to return to this world each year to visit their living relatives.† While modern-day celebrations of Obon have become synonymous with dancing, family reunions and consumption of cultural foods, Obon has a long historical and spiritual significance to Japan. Believed to have originated in India and then later spread throughout Asia, Obon festivities mirror the story of a disciple of Buddha. In the original story, the disciple uses supernatural powers to contact the spirit of his deceased mother. When he finds her in the Realm of Hungry Ghosts,ù the disciple seeks Buddha's help to save her from a fate of insatiable hunger. Through Buddha's instruction, the disciple prepared offerings of food and lanterns for traveling Buddhist monks. Upon doing so, his mother's spirit was freed.† Traditionally, Japanese participants hang lanterns in front of their houses to guide their ancestors' spirits, perform Bon Odori (Japanese folk dances), listen to taiko (the art of Japanese drumming), visit and clean their ancestors' graves and make food offerings at their home altars. At the end of the three-day celebration, floating lanterns are released into bodies of water to guide the spirits back to the realm of the deceased.† According to the lunar calendar, Obon roughly corresponds with the middle of August. Therefore, in Japan, Obon is mainly observed from August 13-16 and is considered one of Japan's three major holiday seasons alongside Golden Week and New Year's. However, according to the solar calendar, Obon falls a month earlier, meaning that in other celebrating countries like the United States, Obon is often observed during the middle of July. Additionally, in China and Vietnam, a similar celebration takes place by the name of the Hungry Ghost Festival. Obon festivals also occur in Malaysia and Korea, though also by different names.† This year, I attended one of the largest Obon celebrations in the U.S.: the 2023 West Los Angeles Buddhist Temple Annual Summer Obon Festival. Halted after the pandemic, the 2023 Obon was the first of its kind in four years. Enthusiastically welcomed back by the Japanese-American community of Los Angeles, this year's Obon was a lively experience.† The gelatin layers that wrapped around the mochi imitated the appearance of sashimi. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus The event effortlessly synthesized traditional elements of Obon with more contemporary components that celebrated the local community. For example, I attended a tea ceremony demonstration, in which the ceremony master followed the Zen Buddhist tradition of carefully preparing cups of matcha according to longstanding choreography. Along with the tea, we were presented with a small mochi confection topped with a sweet gelatin layer and fish decal. Personally, I love the chewy, starchy and subtly sweet flavor of mochi. Unsweetened matcha, on the other hand ¶ not for me.† After the tea ceremony, I toured the panel of booths manned by different fundraising community groups. There was a wide variety: ring toss, a fishbowl-throwing game with live goldfish as prizes, muffin pan Moneyball (a sort of horizontal pachinko), seasonal fruits and vegetables and event merchandise. In addition, the West Los Angeles Buddhist Temple kitchen cooked up some Japanese favorites, including gyoza, curry rice, chili hot dog rice (despite sounding relatively unappetizing, my boyfriend claims this is a beloved Japanese-American staple), onigiri, shaved ice and teriyaki chicken bowls. The gyoza, filled with ground pork, seasonings and chopped cabbage, was steamed to perfection. A side of pickled cabbage also provided a sharp zing to pleasantly contrast with the umami gyoza filling. I also tried the chili hot dog rice, which, while simple, brought a complex flavor profile that transcended cultural borders. The combination of chili, which is speculated to have Texan-Mexican origins, and hot dogs, a distinctly American cuisine, served at a Japanese festival threw my tastebuds for a loop in a surprisingly agreeable way. While not strictly made of Japanese ingredients, chili hot dog rice is a beloved Japanese-American staple. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus The best part of the night (which would have been bingo, had I actually won anything and not wasted $10 on cards) was the Bon Odori. In the outdoor courtyard, large, concentric circles marked in chalk indicated lanes in which to dance. All participants lined up in a lane, the taiko drums started and the dancing proceeded forward slowly in a counterclockwise motion. Having no prior practice with Japanese folk dancing, the Bon Odori circle was daunting at first. However, I was encouraged to simply jump in and mimic the person in front of me. The movements were simple and repeated frequently, making Bon Odori movements easy to pick up and perfect for all age groups. It was rhythmic, soothing and incredibly enjoyable. Anyone who wishes to participate in an upcoming Obon ceremony can Google their local Buddhist temple's event list. For UC Santa Barbara students, the Buddhist Church of Santa Barbara is hosting Obon on August 12. San Luis Obispo (SLO) also offers an Obon celebration at the SLO Buddhist Church on August 5. I highly recommend attending for anyone interested in Japanese food and culture!

on-the-menu,Aperol spritzes fit for a summertime soir√©e,27-Jul-23,9:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-27/aperol-spritzes-fit-for-a-summertime-soiree/,"Transport your tastebuds to Italy with an Aperol spritz. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The Aperol spritz is the drink of the summer î I don't make the rules. But did you know that this warm-weather beverage was born out of a preference to dilute wine? Originating in northern Italy, this orange-hued cocktail takes inspiration from a practice adopted by Austro-Hungarians in the 1800s. Visiting Austro-Hungarian soldiers would add a splash, or spritz in German, of water to northern Italian wines to decrease the wine's intense flavors.† Over time, the spritz evolved from watered-down wine into the mixed drink we know and love today. Padua-born brothers Luigi Barbieri and Silvio Barbieri created Aperol, the signature ingredient of the spritz, in 1919 and debuted the drink at the 1919 Padua International Fair, in line with the emerging European trend of consuming aperitifs as a pre-dinner drink to stimulate one's appetite. Yet, the Aperol Spritz recipe really took off in the 1950s, consisting of three parts prosecco, two parts Aperol and one part soda or sparkling water. The result is a mild, sparkling cocktail with slightly bitter and floral flavor notes from Aperol's key ingredients of oranges, rhubarb and various herbs.† Yield: 1 drink Time: 5 minutes Ingredients: Directions: I hope this simple recipe emphasizes the fact that you don't need to be lounging on the beaches of Positano to indulge in this northern Italian cocktail. This summer, I've been serving Aperol spritzes alongside an array of Italian dishes î homemade pizza, caprese salad, pasta and the like î in an effort to transport my tastebuds to Italy without all the summer travel expenses.† As the spritz has gained popularity in the states, there's been word of American food producers looking to create American liqueur alternatives to Aperol with an emphasis on using locally sourced ingredients rather than depending on this imported product. I'm excited to witness the emergence of more regional variations of this light and refreshing aperitif. But for now, I'm standing by this Italian classic all summer long.†

on-the-menu,Ranking UCSB's most vegetarian-friendly dining halls,24-Aug-23,9:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-24/ranking-ucsbs-most-vegetarian-friendly-dining-halls/,"Esm√© Puzio / Daily Nexus Santa Barbara is known for its sprawling coastline, delicious seafood and Mediterranean climate. As a vegetarian, I worried about the second feature, thinking that perhaps the dining halls at UCSB would have difficulty catering to my lifestyle and diet. However, I was pleasantly surprised that this was usually not the case. While I have had my fair share of run-ins with shark and other seafood delicacies on the menu, there have also been plenty of fairly delicious vegetarian options. However, not all the dining halls I ate at were consistently vegetarian friendly. With that in mind, I created a guide for the best dining options for vegetarians at UCSB. This is not an immutable ranking, as the menus continue to change and evolve at our school but is a pretty thorough one.† Here are, in my experience, the best dining halls for vegetarians: 1. De La Guerra Dining Commons, fondly called DLG. DLG† offers most of what UCSB's other dining halls offer, with a far more extensive breakfast menu that currently includes multigrain waffles and applesauce coffee cake. You can find many cuisines at DLG, from Asian and Pacific Islander dishes to more traditional Western or Hispanic flavors. The most striking feature of DLG is the ice cream bar, which cannot be found at any of the other dining halls. It has a variety of delicious scoopable ice cream flavors, with dispensable wafer and sugar cones. DLG also contains a taqueria section where you can assemble your own tacos with a mix of rice, salsas and different types of tortillas, though typically there isn't a vegetarian protein option. Overall, this dining hall offers the most vegetarian options for each meal, with ample seating area to boot, which is why I would rank it first on my list for vegetarians. 2. Carrillo Dining Commons As a freshman in the San Rafael Residence Hall, Carillo was the closest and thus the dining hall most frequented by me and I can confidently say that they serve the best vegetarian dinner. The Mongolian grill always features some combination of vegetarian rice or noodles with a variety of savory and sweet flavors, and visitors are always provided with the option of dousing their dish in chili oil or peanut sauce if they please. They also have an array of delicious meatless pasta, my favorite being the pesto penne pasta, which I always sprinkle heavily with parmesan cheese. My favorite meal at Carillo is lunch when the veggie burgers are served. With a variety of patties from lentil-based to black bean that you can top with vegetables, cheeses and dressings of your own choosing, lunch at Carillo is hard to beat. I also enjoy the variety that Carillo provides, with surprise dishes presented in certain weeks. My favorite surprise dish on the menu is likely the cream of tomato soup, which I was lucky enough to get one day with grilled cheese from the grill section. This dining hall might be my personal favorite, but it isn't as vegetarian friendly as DLG.† 3. Ortega Dining Commons takeout Now I know Ortega is not a dining hall in the traditional sense, but the takeout options provided can sometimes be a great option for vegetarians. I have had some poor experiences with certain items, such as the bean burrito and veggie burger, which came out a little soggier than I would've liked due to the foil wrapping trapping the heat. However, if you order pasta, curry and rice or salad from Ortega, you are likely to not be disappointed. In fact, Ortega has managed to exceed my expectations at times. I would say my favorite all time Ortega order would be between the strawberry fresca salad and cheese ravioli. In general, Ortega offers substantial snack options such as celery and carrot sticks with hummus and cookies. However, in the entr√©e department, Ortega is not so vegetarian friendly. 4. Portola Dining Commons† While Portola is the largest dining hall at UCSB, its off-campus location can make it inaccessible for students situated in on-campus dorms. For that reason, I have only journeyed to Portola a few times and found myself disappointed by the lack of options. The interesting dishes, such as the sushi, that make Portola so well-loved among students are obviously inaccessible to vegetarians. One of the times I went to Portola, I found myself unable to eat most of the dishes, save for some soft, boiled vegetables. While this can be filling, it isn't the first option I or any vegetarian, in my opinion, would choose. I'm sure Portola has its better days and features more vegetarian-friendly meals, but overall I found them unappealing. Portola doesn't offer anything vegetarian that one couldn't find in another dining hall, and so I would rank it last on my list. However, if you do live in the San Catalina towers, stick around and you may be surprised. Each dining hall does offer at least some vegetarian meals which you can modify yourself using the provided condiments if unappetizing. The beauty of having four dining options is that you never have to eat at the same dining hall consistently if you don't want to. So, mix it up! I recommend checking the menu online each week for all the dining halls, picking out which vegetarian meals you prefer best and scheduling accordingly. No matter what you choose, you won't be left hungry. Except if you have pizza ¶ A version of this article appeared on p. 20 of the Aug. 24 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,A third-year's guide to the best IV restaurants,24-Aug-23,10:00 AM,['Amitha Bhat'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-24/a-third-years-guide-to-the-best-iv-restaurants/," As a proud resident of Isla Vista for the last two years, I'm happy to say that I have consumed meals from a substantial number of restaurants in the area. What's a student to do when confined to the bounds of the city, and only has the choice to either consume Carrillo's famed stir-fry with vegetables for the tenth time that week, or to refresh their palate with a classic IV delicacy?† For those post-midterm moments when your local dining hall's menu just won't satiate your standards for a victory meal or snack, here are some of the most delectable Isla Vista restaurants (in no particular order).† Super Cuca's† My first time trying Cuca's was mid-way through my second year. Aside from the initial astoundment I experienced when first biting into a Cuca's burrito, my second thought was one of bewilderment: How have I not eaten here before? Cuca's is relatively close to my former homeland of San Rafael Residence Hall, and yet I hadn't felt the need to check it out until winter quarter. With their cost-efficient, large portion sizes î which are perfect for leftovers î Cuca's became an immediate favorite. My go-to items are the Cuca's breakfast burrito (available all-day) and the vegetarian nachos!†† Kaiju When I think of Kaiju, I recall eating lunch with one of my friends after a torturous final last December. Somehow, their curry udon managed to cure me of the post-final blues. Rather than wondering if B was the right answer for question #33, I was instead focusing on each warm and flavorful bite, all while updating my friend on some life events that were transpiring. Kaiju also holds the top spot in my ranking for best boba in IV, and what better to wash down a hearty bowl of udon with than a mango green tea (with lychee jelly, of course)?† CAJ√â If I were vocally narrating this list, now is the point where I'd most likely break out into unintelligible screams, or perhaps compose a song to express my unwavering love for CAJ√â. Dare I say ¶ they have the best coffee and bagels in Isla Vista. On an occasional Sunday morning, I'll execute the brunch masterplan with a friend: The Worksù bagel sandwich on jalape√±o cheddar, a hot mocha (with oat milk) in a ceramic coffee mug and some intellectually stimulating conversation. CAJ√â intimately understands the coveted coffee-bagel experience, and I support them in this endeavor.† Woodstock's At this point in the list, we may be getting a bit controversial. Woodstock's is definitely my favorite pizza joint in IV, but half of my reasoning is sentimental, so feel free to take this one with a grain of salt. I normally grab a slice to go when I get back late from meetings or study sessions in the library. It's quick, delicious and as someone who prefers her pizza with extra crust, the foldover crust is ideal. Pro-tip: I ask for marinara sauce and ranch î dip the crust in marinara sauce and the pizza in ranch. Woodstock's holds the title of my Freshman Year Comfort Foodù î even in the pitfalls of my first year of college, I'd grab a slice, rewatch Gilmore Girls and tune out reality.† Dank Bowls Picture this: it's a crisp November evening. The air is fresh, and you're wearing your favorite autumn sweater. There are no meetings today and no midterm in the foreseeable future î not even a treacherous paper or homework assignment looming over your head. You know exactly what needs to be done. Time to concoct the elite order for a cold day like this one: the Buff Daddyù Mac and Cheese, Tomato Basil Soup and some bread on the side. As you indulge in this feast in the comfort of your own home, you imagine you're Adam Driver in Girls.ù Good soup, indeed.† Spudnuts I think I've indoctrinated most of my friends and acquaintances into the art of eating a Spudnuts donut. Never in my 19 years and 11.5 months of life has anything melted in my mouth the way a Spudnuts donut has î this may be due to their magical formula that includes potatoes. I applaud them for creating the ultimate donut, which I venture to say may even be on par with the renowned Stan's Donuts, in my hometown of Santa Clara. My favorite item is the maple bar, and if you catch me ordering two of them î no, you didn't. There are many more scrumptious foods in Isla Vista, but since I had to keep my list brief, here are some honorable mentions: Z√≥calo, Freebirds, Lao Wang (specifically their tofu buns) and Hummus Republic.† Thank you very much for reading, and welcome to Isla Vista! I can only hope you enjoy these restaurants as much as I do, and here's to many victory meals as you embark on your first year of university!† According to my younger brother's acquaintance, I've were given bs02 my first test general of $19,000, quite cool.

Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus During the summer months, the food scene in Santa Barbara County has witnessed drastic changes î the loss of longtime Isla Vista eatery Pho Bistro, the opening of Isla Vista's first mini food hall and announcements of projected restaurant arrivals. Just in time for the upcoming school year, read on for more on these Isla Vista and Goleta closures and openings.† Pho Bistro closes, ASIA 101 opens Vietnamese restaurant Pho Bistro closed in June. An Isla Vista staple since its opening in 2007, the restaurant served menu items including pad thai, pho, fried rice and more. The space's new tenant, another Asian eatery called ASIA 101, recently opened in mid-August at 903 Embarcadero del Norte. ASIA 101 is a sister restaurant of Mojo Asian Fusion Cafe, a cafe specializing in bubble tea drinks on Seville Road. The eatery offers Asian fusion cuisine, noodles and fried tapas.† Crumbl Cookies expands to Goleta Signage announcing the arrival of Crumbl Cookies has appeared at 5562 Calle Real. Founded in 2017 in Utah, the viral cookie chain has expanded rapidly since the onset of the pandemic with over 800 stores in the U.S. While customers can always expect a classic chocolate chip cookie on the menu, the bakery features a weekly rotating menu at all locations with flavors including caramel shortbread and cookies and cream. An opening date has not yet been announced.† Maria's Tacos opens on Pardall On June 27, Mexican restaurant Maria's Tacos celebrated its grand opening on 6545 Pardall Road. The restaurant prides itself on using homemade tortillas for all of their tacos. Their small menu features burritos, tortas and a variety of tacos, including al pastor and baja fish tacos. All menu items are under $13 with tacos priced between $3.50 to $4.75 each. Customers can order housemade agua fresca and horchata to pair with their meal. Maria's Tacos is currently still in its soft opening phase with plans to expand its menu offerings.† New restaurant Social Eats currently features Pop!s Burgers & Shakes and Street Noods. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Isla Vista gets its first food hall Los Angeles-based food hall Social Eats first debuted in 2018 on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. Their food hall concept presents offerings from several different eateries all under one roof, giving customers the ability to order items from different restaurants. In comparison to a large scale food hall such as the Santa Barbara Public Market, each restaurant featured at Social Eats operates in the same kitchen rather than at different stands. The Isla Vista location on 6521 Pardall Road currently features two of Social Eats' vendors: Pop!s Burgers & Shakes and Street Noods. There is extensive indoor and outdoor seating as well as drinks on tap.† Luna Grill is coming to Isla Vista The Restaurant Guy reported that Luna Grill is expanding its locations in Santa Barbara County. Luna Grill specializes in Mediterranean cuisine with menu items ranging from falafel pitas to chicken kabob plates. With one location on upper State Street, the Southern California-based chain plans to open restaurants in Montecito and Isla Vista sometime in 2024.

on-the-menu,Welcome fall with apple cinnamon rolls,14-Sep-23,9:48 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-09-14/welcome-fall-with-apple-cinnamon-rolls/,"Making cinnamon rolls from scratch is a long process, but the result is worth it. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Halloween candy already lines the grocery store shelves. Spirit Halloween costume shops are open. Pumpkin spice lattes are back at Starbucks. It's official: fall is here.† Sure, UCSB is still on vacation for a few more weeks and the sunny Isla Vista weather will continue for a few more months, but there's something so comforting about fall that I personally don't mind cutting summer a little short. Fall, by definition, is the coziest season. The air is just chill enough to bring out my cute chunky sweaters and soup recipes but not so freezing that I'm questioning whether to turn on our apartment's janky heater that may or may not have mice living in it.† But until I get that desperate, heating up the oven for some freshly baked goods does the trick. Arguably, fall has the best seasonal treats. Pumpkin bread, pecan pie, chai spice cookies ¶ the list goes on and on. But, for me, apples are my go-to ingredient for fall. Apples pair perfectly with spices, caramel, nuts and brown sugar î all quintessential fall flavors î and they conveniently come into season at the start of September.† Recently, my favorite way to incorporate apples is baked into cinnamon rolls. Other than rolling small chunks of apples into the dough, there are no other changes to my basic cinnamon roll recipe. For the amount of fall flavor that the apple chunks bring, adding this one extra step is a no-brainer.† When baking with apples, it's important to remember that not all apple varieties will work. Because hot temperatures cause apples to secrete their juice out, firmer apples are preferred for baking. I recommend Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Cortland or Honeygold apples. Softer apples, like Fuji, Gala and Red Delicious, will secrete more juice while baking, which could ruin the rise of your rolls.† Apple Cinnamon Rolls Yield: 15 rolls† Time: 4 hours Ingredients: For the bread dough: For the filling: For the frosting: Directions: Making cinnamon rolls from scratch is a long process, but the result is worth it. If you want them for breakfast and don't want to wake up at 6 a.m. to finish them by 10 a.m., you can start making them the night before. Instead of letting the sliced rolls rise in a warm place, put them in your fridge overnight and continue to Step 9 in the morning. Cold environments slow yeast activity down, but if you let the rolls sit all night, they'll be done rising by morning.† Not only will these rolls taste amazing, but your whole house will smell like a Bath & Body Works apple spice candle. Happy fall!

on-the-menu,Take advantage of California fig season with this fall salad,24-Sep-23,10:52 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-09-24/take-advantage-of-california-fig-season-with-this-fall-salad/,"My salad philosophy goes as follows: a significant amount of crunch, a touch of nuttiness, something creamy and something slightly sweet. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus I'm growing tired of seeing my restaurant bill and groaning, consistently perplexed at the current prices of restaurant food. On a college student budget, it's hard to eat out in Santa Barbara without thinking about how my $29 could have been spent on a small grocery haul instead of an admittedly mediocre pasta dish plus tip at a buzzy restaurant downtown.† I spent some time this summer exploring Japan with my sister, eating everything and marveling at the low cost of food (the yen is quite weak now, so most of our meals were under $10). At the same time, I was shocked by the lack of fruit and vegetables present on most restaurants' menus (most of the produce consumed in Japan must be imported). Thus, I returned to the States craving a big salad after subsisting on udon and sushi and not cooking once for two weeks. And I was deterred by the aforementioned restaurant prices back home in the Bay Area.† This is all a long-winded excuse to share the salad recipe I've been making recently as summer transitions into fall. My salad philosophy goes as follows: a significant amount of crunch, a touch of nuttiness, something creamy and something slightly sweet. Salads have a reputation for being boring and unsatisfying, but this variation, packed with a variety of fresh and cooked ingredients, challenges that assumption.† Yields: 5 servings Time: 30 minutes Ingredients: For the salad: For the roasted cauliflower and beans: For the dressing:† Directions: I'm convinced that Sweetgreen would charge $15 for this exact salad combination. I'm also convinced that this salad might just make eating salads enjoyable for the very first time. Your window to make this recipe is slowly closing as the California fig season ends in November. So, head to your local grocery store or, preferably, a farmers market to pick up the freshest figs and give this early autumn salad a try!†

on-the-menu,Third annual Burrito Week offers $8 burritos from 21 Santa Barbara County establishments,5-Oct-23,10:04 AM,"['Stephanie Gerson', 'Abigail Monti', 'Mari Villalpando-Ortega']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-05/third-annual-burrito-week-offers-8-burritos-from-21-santa-barbara-county-establishments/,"The Pico de Gallo Nopalitos Breakfast Burrito was unlike any burrito I've tried before. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The Santa Barbara Independent has invited 21 establishments in Santa Barbara in the past two years to participate in their annual Burrito Week, offering special burritos and familiar favorites at a discounted price. This year, burritos were priced at $8, a dollar increase from previous years.† In preparation for Burrito Week, which lasted from Sept. 21-27, staff at the Independent sampled these special burritos to give us an idea of what to expect.† Burrito Week isn't just about offering over 20 burritos for the affordable price of $8 ì a price that UC Santa Barbara students wished could remain year-round. Rather, the larger emphasis of the Independent's week-long burrito extravaganza is placed upon highlighting small and family-owned restaurants and taquerias throughout Santa Barbara. Participating establishments offer unique variations, exploring how to elevate this beloved food by sticking to classic burrito fillings or implementing unexpected flavors. The Daily Nexus staff seized the opportunity to try out a few of the burritos on the list for themselves before fall quarter started. El Zarape's Pico de Gallo Nopalitos Breakfast Burrito By Stephanie Gerson† Locals believe that El Zarape Mexican restaurant on the Westside has perfected their breakfast burrito, with the restaurant earning a Santa Barbara Independent Foodie Award in 2016 for its breakfast burrito variations. This year is El Zarape's third time participating in Burrito Week, but the taqueria concocted a new special this year instead of offering the Breakfast Pasilla Pepper Burrito as they did in 2021 and 2022. This year's featured burrito, the Pico de Gallo Nopalitos Breakfast Burrito, is unlike any burrito I've tried before. Encased in a flaky and light flour tortilla are scrambled eggs, onions, pinto beans, pico de gallo, jalapeno and the star of the show: nopales or leaves from a prickly pear cactus. Chunks of nopales are put inside the burrito as well as added to the scrambled egg mixture. The nopales are sourced locally in Santa Barbara and grilled, giving them a chewy, hearty texture and slightly bitter taste.† A generous amount of pico de gallo provides some heat to the burrito without overpowering the other flavors. I appreciated the freshness of the pico de gallo which offset the savory eggs and beans. I also chose to eat my burrito with a generous helping of salsa verde. When ordering breakfast burritos, I'm often concerned about receiving something soggy, but El Zarape toasts one side of their burritos in a pan before serving to give their burritos a bit more structure and crunch.† As my first introduction to nopales and the food at El Zarape, I was pleasantly surprised. My only request is that they continue to serve this burrito year-round!† The carnitas burrito, paired with rice and beans, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole, was the pinnacle of any burrito in Santa Barbara. Mari Villalpando-Ortega / Daily Nexus Los Agaves' $8 Carnitas Burrito By Mari Villalpando-Ortega In celebration of Burrito Week in Santa Barbara and welcoming myself back to Isla Vista for the school year a burrito from Los Agaves was just what I needed. Especially for the special deal of $8 î in Santa Barbara, that's a price you simply cannot top. The carnitas burrito was wrapped in a freshly warmed tortilla and packed with flavor. The carnitas themselves were delicious, but paired with the signature rice and beans, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole, it was the pinnacle of any burrito in Santa Barbara. The savory meat combined with the freshness of the sour cream, lettuce and pico de gallo made for a perfect bite, complimenting the richness of the carnitas so perfectly. I am usually† picky about the ratio of rice and beans in a burrito, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that they don't overdo it with these two. Additionally, the flour tortilla was grilled on one side but still soft. With every bite of the burrito, I had some of my favorite guacamole, salsa and a bit of the chips they provided.† I always think that the sign of a good Mexican restaurant is that they give you chips and dip while you wait for your food to come out. When I moved to Isla Vista, I thought the days in which I would re-encounter such deliciousness and service were gone until I stumbled upon Los Agaves after the worst hangover of my young life. An honorable mention is the jamaica they serve, which is a refreshing drink with just the right sweetness and tang, perfect for a hot afternoon. I will definitely be back for more, even if I have to pay full price. Packed with protein, eggs, cheese and potatoes, and melted to perfection, their breakfast burritos make the morning sun shine a little brighter. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Super Cuca's Sausage Breakfast Burrito By Abigail Monti Without a doubt, Super Cuca's is a beloved favorite of I.V. residents. After all, UCSB students voted Super Cucas as having the Best Burritoù in last year's Best of 2022-2023ù awards. With their huge selection of options î including enchiladas, taco plates, quesadillas, tortas, burritos, agua frescas and smoothies î and their inflation-resistant prices, it's no wonder why.† But today I am here to bring attention to a lesser-recognized section of their menu: their breakfast burritos. Packed with protein, eggs, cheese and potatoes, and melted to perfection, their burritos make the morning sun shine a little brighter. Genuinely, Super Cuca's breakfast burritos were the reason why I made it to half my 8 a.m. classes last quarter. To celebrate Burrito Week, I ordered the Sausage Breakfast Burrito and smothered it with ranchero salsa. As always, it did not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of savory breakfasts and Super Cuca's knows how to nail the ratio of salty, spicy and umami. In addition to the Sausage Breakfast Burrito, Super Cuca's offers an incredible 12 other breakfast burrito options. In the past, I've tried and loved their Protein Breakfast Burrito and Bacon Burrito. Based on their stellar consistency from dish to dish, I'd confidently guess that the other iterations are just as tasty. Not to mention, Super Cuca's is known for serving up massive portions. Personally, one of their breakfast burritos lasts me two breakfasts. While this might not be true for everyone, their price-to-portion ratio is impressive regardless. Honestly, out of the 21 participating restaurants, Super Cuca's regular prices might be the closest to the $8 deal. They charge a reasonable $10.49 for most of their meat breakfast burritos and only $8.89 for their meatless variation. Even when the Burrito Week deal ends, you can bet I'll still be stopping by.

on-the-menu,Goleta Lemon Festival celebrates its 30th year of lemony eats and activities for all,5-Oct-23,10:20 AM,"['Stephanie Gerson', 'Abigail Monti']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-05/goleta-lemon-festival-celebrates-its-30th-year-of-lemony-eats-and-activities-for-all/,"strwEATs' strawberry lemon tamales took a surprisingly sweet twist on the traditional savory dish. Shiuan Cheng/Daily Nexus The Goleta Lemon Festival celebrated its 30th year of citrus-themed festivities this past weekend. From Sept. 30 to Oct. 1, Goleta locals and lemon enthusiasts from across California convened at Girsh Park to celebrate. The agricultural festival has grown to become the largest community event of the year, attracting over 40,000 visitors each year! This year's festival was the largest yet, with more than 100 booths hosted by local businesses, nonprofits, craftsmen and restaurants. Despite family attractions such as live music, bungee jumping, bouncy houses, a mini train and Saturday's classic car show, the food court remained the weekend's main squeeze. In addition to county fair favorites, many booths put lemony twists on traditional fare. After a day of lemony treats, here is what we deemed worth the try. Lemon lavender shaved ice from Kona Ice Kona Ice of Santa Barbara served shaved ice cups throughout the day to help festival-goers beat the unexpected early October heat. The truck featured a self-service syrup station where customers could dispense their desired amount of syrup atop their mounds of shaved ice. We opted for lemon lavender, the truck's flavor of the day and one of their several lemony creations offered specifically for the festival. The icy treat was definitely refreshing and while the notes of lavender were quite strong, the lemon flavors in the syrup just weren't as present, leading us to rate Kona Ice's lemony offerings an 8/10.† Lemon lavender-flavored shaved ice was the perfect refreshing treat during the hot festival. Shiuan Cheng/Daily Nexus Lemon bars and lemon cotton candy from the Santa Barbara South Coast Chamber of Commerce This year, I came to the lemon festival on a mission: to devour a lemon bar. I've been dreaming about the one I ate last year at the festival since the moment I threw away the empty container. Sourced from Anna's Bakery, the Santa Barbara South Coast Chamber of Commerce resells large-portion lemon bars and lemon meringue pie slices for just $5. The year-long wait was worth it î the lemon bar was three square inches of edible happiness. The lemon curd filling provided strong notes of tart lemon flavor, but the buttery crust perfectly balanced it out so neither was too overpowering. Needless to say, I'm already thinking about next year's lemon bar. Unsurprisingly, we rated the lemon bar a perfect 10/10.† Along with baked goods, the Santa Barbara South Coast Chamber of Commerce also served up lemon cotton candy for the same price. The nostalgic treat came in large portions and was tinted pastel yellow. Despite its color, the cotton candy failed to deliver much lemony flavor. Even though it wasn't very tart, we agreed that it was a quality cotton candy regardless, earning a 7/10 rating. The Santa Barbara South Coast Chamber of Commerce spun tufts of lemony cotton candy throughout the day. Shiuan Cheng/Daily Nexus Lemon Flavored Churro from Tacos Before Vatos Out of all the lemony treats we tried, our group was the most skeptical about this one î after all, cinnamon and lemon are hardly an intuitive combination. But Tacos Before Vatos' sign proudly proclaimed their lemon churros as award-winning; we would be the judge of that. To the naked eye, the churro was obviously covered in yellow-tinted sugar, but upon tasting it, we struggled to discern much lemon flavor. Tacos Before Vatos also chose to forgo cinnamon, a smart choice in my opinion, but that left the dessert a little under-seasoned. However, the sweet fried dough redeemed some points in other categories: it was chewy, quite large and still warm î everything I look for in a good churro. But it was just that, a churro, not a lemon flavored one. Due to its underwhelming flavor, we rated the lemon churro a 5/10. Lemon Strawberry Tamales from strwEATs strwEATs, a Ventura-based dessert business specializing in all things strawberry-flavored, immediately caught our attention among the overwhelming number of food vendors in Girsh Park. Their tent offered strawberry lemonade, strawberry cupcakes, fresas con crema and the item that we were both nervous and extremely excited to try: lemon-strawberry tamales. This special variation of strwEATs' strawberry dessert tamales featured soft and lightly sweetened, lemon-infused masa (tamale dough) and the perfect ratio of strawberry jam filling. While a sweet tamale is common in various Latine communities, it was an unexpected and unfamiliar dessert for us. We appreciated strwEATs' ability to put a twist on one of their pre-existing menu items and feature strong citrus flavors for this special occasion, awarding the lemon-strawberry tamales a 10/10 rating.

on-the-menu,Buena Onda brings a piece of Argentina to Santa Barbara with community events and hand crafted empanadas,12-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-12/buena-onda-brings-a-piece-of-argentina-to-santa-barbara-with-community-events-and-hand-crafted-empanadas/,"The fillings and dough for the empanadas are made on Mondays and Tuesdays as the empanadas are baked to order. Courtesy of Buena Onda. Up until a decade ago, it was next to impossible to find authentic Argentinian-style empanadas in the Santa Barbara area. When Matias Requena and his family moved to Santa Barbara from their coastal hometown of Mar de Plata, Argentina, in 2002, the coastal California environment felt reminiscent of home but the absence of this Argentine staple was certainly present. Even if empanadas were available in the States, they strayed from the Argentine authentic flavors that the Requena family enjoyed eating; they were Americanized, made from corn instead of flour and fried instead of baked.†† Acclimating to his new home, Matias Requena spent his first 10 years in Santa Barbara working in the local restaurant scene at establishments such as seafood restaurant Brophy Bros. and the now-closed, high-end Mexican restaurant Cielito.† I think the combination of having [restaurant] experience myself and wanting to share my culture with guests made me want to bring our cuisine to Santa Barbara,ù Requena said.† Yet it was a family road trip in the Patagonia region of Argentina in 2012 that truly solidified Requena's idea to share authentic Argentine empanadas with the population of Santa Barbara. Requena's mother, Malena, was living in Argentina at the time and had cooked four dozen chicken empanadas for the family to fuel their cross-country excursion. After subsisting on empanadas for several days, Requena gained more appreciation for the easy, handheld nature of the food. He also didn't realize how much he missed the taste of his mother's handmade empanadas and knew others would love them as much as he always had.† Matias Requena started the business with his mother Malena. Courtesy of Buena Onda. Once Malena moved back to Santa Barbara in 2014, the process of establishing Buena Onda, the family's empanada business, began.† Buena Onda, which translates to good vibesù in English, is a way of expressing that you get along with someone right away î that you òvibe' with someone's energy. The phrase was not only a part of Argentine vernacular, but it also embodied the type of environment and community that the Requena family wanted to build.† To us, the name represents not only people we love but also providing good food with a whole lot of love behind it,ù Requena said.† Recipe testing began at home that year in the family's kitchen while the family waited to find a larger, commercial space in which to make and sell their empanadas. With friends acting as their taste testers, the Requenas perfected the family empanada recipe just in time for a larger kitchen space to become available. In 2015, Buena Onda rented out the kitchen from the now-shuttered, American breakfast and lunch restaurant Goodland Kitchen in Old Town Goleta on Magnolia Ave, allowing their business to finally take off. Once Goodland Kitchen stopped meal service for the day, Buena Onda would take over the space, serving their empanadas and playing lively Argentine music into the evening. The after-hours pop-up only lasted three months, but was an instant success, resulting in outpouring community support for Buena Onda.† The original vision was always to open a restaurant space, but finding such a location in Santa Barbara was difficult and costly. The Requenas rented another kitchen space from a catering company at 724 E. Haley Street to produce empanadas for takeout but purchased a mobile wood-fired oven to use when catering special events like weddings and corporate gatherings. For three years, Buena Onda operated as a catering service until the catering company from which they were leasing offered to sell the Haley Street building to the Requenas in 2018. This allowed the family to further focus on how to curate a cozy restaurant vibe to accommodate their comforting dishes that tasted like home.† Since the beginning, collaborating with other small food and beverage businesses in Santa Barbara has been a helpful tool in growing Buena Onda's already very enthusiastic customer base. So it felt like a no-brainer when Buena Onda was approached about selling their empanadas at Mosaic Locale on State Street in 2018 alongside other businesses including Draughtsmen Aleworks and Old Town Coffee.† It was like having roommates in a house,ù Requena said about the early days of selling his empanadas at Mosaic Locale alongside so many friends in the same industry. Customers could pair their empanadas with a cup of coffee or pint of beer from other participating businesses, supporting several local restaurateurs with a single purchase. The cooperative concept was also aimed to revive State Street as the downtown area was facing complaints from residents for feeling sleepy and unexciting. Buena Onda's station at Mosaic Locale helped get their name out there and drove traffic to their newly established restaurant on Haley Street. While Buena Onda eventually outgrew the Mosaic Locale space, the business still facilitates wholesale orders of empanadas for Draughtsmen Aleworks' outpost in the mini food hall downtown.† The restaurant space on Haley Street features a cozy outdoor patio that also serves as an event venue for Argentine musicians and dance nights. Courtesy of Buena Onda. Once Buena Onda began to expand, Requena described updating their recipes as a team effortù among members of the family and the kitchen staff. Basing their core empanada recipe off of the tried-and-true variation developed by Malena in Argentina, head chef Lupe Donjuan, chef Tom√°s Baistrocchi and Requena collaborated on the empanada flavors and chimichurri recipe, a dipping sauce made from parsley, garlic, olive oil and various spices that is paired with all empanadas.† Crafting Buena Onda's signature empanadas is a multi-day process to ensure the business can regularly produce thousands every week. Mondays are dedicated to making the empanada fillings ì seasoning the beef, chicken and vegetables that will later be inserted into the pockets of dough ì and hand-kneading the dough. Tuesdays are spent feeding the dough into a machine that thins the dough to reach the perfect consistency, cutting the dough into disks, adding the filling to the empanadas and closing the empanadas. After these two days of preparing and assembling the empanadas, they are placed in a fridge and chilled; each batch of empanadas is baked to order, resulting in the ultimate freshness and best flavor.†† Buena Onda's empanada varieties stay true to the flavors of Argentina while also acknowledging other global influences. Requena grew up eating beef empanadas, which he considers to be the most authentic Argentine flavor present in Buena Onda's empanadas, yet also wanted the business to appeal to the California palate and Italian cuisine, which is widely consumed in Argentina due to the country's sizable Italian population. These influences result in dishes such as their caprese empanada which is crafted with organic roma tomatoes, mozzarella, basil and olive oil. In an effort to make their menu accessible to those with dietary restrictions and speak to plant-focused, Californian preferences, Buena Onda's menu also features vegan versions of their signature empanadas made with special vegan dough and fillings such as kale, quinoa and vegan cheese.† As the Buena Onda name spread throughout Santa Barbara, the motivation to do more than just empanadas grew. Input from fellow restaurateur Ramon Velazquez, who owns Coraz√≥n Comedor, helped Requena decide to serve something green with their empanadas which manifested itself through serving salads, potatoes and grilled vegetable platters at the restaurant. In their catering days, Buena Onda would typically feature specials at such events alongside their baked empanadas. One of these specialties included Argentine asado, or barbecued meat, and milanesas, breaded steak, which is now served at the restaurant in a sandwich or on a plate with fries and salad. Frequently, Requena travels back home to Argentina both to connect with his roots and gain recipe inspiration for Buena Onda's latest menu items.† At events catered by Buena Onda, customers can expect special items including Argentine asado. Courtesy of Buena Onda. The pandemic was a challenging time for Buena Onda, especially since the restaurant had only been operating for two years. With the announcement of the shelter-in-place order, Matias quickly brainstormed ways to keep the business afloat and came up with the idea of offering no-contact deliveries throughout the Santa Barbara area of frozen empanadas that customers could bake in their ovens at home. COVID-19 also sparked several unexpected partnerships with local bars. In order for bars and clubs to continue operating during the pandemic, Santa Barbara County required such establishments to serve food. Cocktail bars, The Good Lion and EOS Lounge, started to place wholesale orders from Buena Onda during this time, which in turn helped Buena Onda's empanadas reach a wider audience. It really made us pivot in a very fortunate way,ù Requena said regarding how the pandemic opened up new opportunities for wholesale distribution that Buena Onda has continued since the pandemic.† In post-pandemic times, the Requenas were eager to use their restaurant space as a venue for events to share Argentine music and culture. Since the opening of their restaurant in 2018, Buena Onda has hosted various performances by both Latin and non-Latin musicians for patrons to enjoy. After a year devoid of large gatherings, Buena Onda made an effort to host community events and help members of the community reconnect with each other. The restaurant's outdoor patio is frequently used as a dance floor for dance nights in collaboration with Nomad Tango, a nonprofit that organizes Argentine tango nights.
 Buena Onda's 2022 World Cup watch party celebrated Argentina's victory. Courtesy of Oscar Gomez. Requena's dream since the restaurant opened was to host his own World Cup watch party for the Argentinian and extended community. When the Argentina men's soccer team entered the World Cup final, Requena organized a series of watch parties on the patio to cheer on his home team among other devoted fans. The event series was incredibly successful, with over 100 people gathered around a single flat-screen to watch every game, decked out in their blue and white striped jerseys. Buena Onda's patio on that Sunday in December at 6 a.m. felt like being transported to an actual stadium with a lively celebration complete with confetti, drums, drinks and waving flags that followed Argentina's victory.† Requena doesn't deny the immense challenges of operating a restaurant, especially one that tapped into the niche of Argentine cuisine, with which Santa Barbara residents were less familiar. But witnessing the public participate in celebrations of Argentine culture through tango nights, soccer match screenings and, of course, dining on authentic Argentine fare made all of the past setbacks worth overcoming.† Building a family here within the business and all the people you meet, and all the people you feed is something great that came out of all of this,ù Requena said.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the October 12, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Spice Up Your Life with these Red Chili Fries!,12-Oct-23,10:06 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-12/spice-up-your-life-with-these-red-chili-fries/,"Christy Yu / Daily Nexus Growing up, spice was the most valued currency î not just in my mother's kitchen, but in the economy of my household. Any problem or fight could be resolved with a spicy dish, angry or sad tears replaced with euphoric ones. My favorite comfort dish, weaponized by my mother to win my affection every chance she gets, are red chili fries. The warm blend of spices includes the divine kala namak,ù or black salt, which is manufactured in mines located on the base of the Himalayas and traditionally used in the Indian subcontinent. My mom typically purchases this salt in bulk at the local Indian store, but I've found that you can order it through Target's website. If you can't get your hands on any kala namak, you can always substitute it with a different salty seasoning of your choosing, and you can find my replacement recommendation below. Though I prefer fries fried in oil, I found that the flavor is just as robust if prepared in an air fryer. The choice is up to you, but here's my mother's recipe: Red chili fries† Yield: 1 Serving Time: 35 minutes Ingredients: Instructions: If you aren't big on spice, you can skip the red chili powder and just go with the black salt, table salt and lime for some savory, delicious fries. But, then again, if you weren't big on spice, you wouldn't have clicked on this recipe! For you, I would say throw in whatever spices you like, such as cayenne or Sichuan pepper powder, and see what spice flavor profile suits you. I believe no two lovers of spice have the same exact preferences. For me, whenever I get my hands on French fries, I cannot resist adding a dash of spice, a preference that somehow turned into an innate habit. Try these fries, and perhaps you won't be able to forget them either.  A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the October 12, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Brewing 101: A beginner's guide to the perfect cup of coffee,19-Oct-23,10:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-19/brewing-101-a-beginners-guide-to-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee/,"Jessie Zhu / Daily Nexus A cup of coffee is an everyday ritual for many, but for even frequent coffee drinkers, the coffee world can get confusing. What's the difference between a light and a dark roast? Is espresso any different from regular coffee? Where does coffee even come from? Your coffee should be something that doesn't stress you out. Here, we answer everything you need to know about the basics of coffee. What we know as coffee beans are actually seeds derived from the coffee cherry fruit. When these raw beans are harvested, they are green, acidic and very hard. Roasting is what turns the beans into the coffee that we know and love. High temperatures create chemical reactions that change the flavors of the beans, so the duration of roasting is what produces different types of roasts, ranging from light to dark.† Light roast coffee is typically only roasted until the beans first crack, which produces a loud sound. At this point, the coffee is drinkable. Light roast usually has more of an acidic, citrusy and fruity flavor with a light body. The term bodyù is often used as a descriptor of a coffee's flavor. This doesn't have anything to do with the coffee bean, but with the texture of the coffee it produces. Body describes the density or viscosity of the coffee. For example, a full-bodied coffee might be thicker and creamier than a light-bodied coffee. Light roast also has a flavor that is most authentic to its origins, which can vary based on where the coffee was sourced. Medium roast coffee is usually roasted past the first crack but before the second one. This produces a coffee bean that is slightly darker and, unsurprisingly, has medium acidity and body. Medium roast has a flavor that still stays true to its origins, but begins to adopt more of the caramelized sweetness that roasting produces. Lastly, dark roasting produces coffee beans that are very dark brown, or even close to black. Dark roast coffee tastes less acidic but more bitter and holds a smoky, nutty or chocolate flavor with a full body. Dark roast is typically what you would think strong coffee tastes like. In addition, much of the original flavors of the beans are lost. Although light, medium and dark roast are easy ways of referring to a type of coffee roast, there are many roasts that fall in between these categories and produce various flavors. A common misconception is that dark roast coffee has the highest caffeine content because it is the strongest. In actuality, caffeine levels stay the same during the entire roasting process. However, there will be a slight difference if the coffee is measured by volume versus weight. Beans further along in the roasting process have reduced mass from water loss and become larger in size. So, if beans are measured by volume with a scoop, dark roast beans will have less caffeine because they are bigger and take up more space. But if the beans are measured by weight, dark roast beans will have more caffeine because they weigh less. In other words, more dark roast beans are required in order to reach the same weight as light roast beans. Measuring by weight is the most accepted method and, therefore, results in dark roast coffee often containing more caffeine. However, no matter which method is used, there is a very minimal difference in caffeine content between light- and dark-roasted coffee.† So, what about espresso? While served in cute cups, they can pack a punch. Espresso uses all levels of roast and the difference is really in the method by which the coffee is brewed. Many people love espresso for its strong flavor, so medium and dark roasts are typically used. Hot water is forced through finely ground coffee beans at high pressure to produce a very highly concentrated coffee. The result î a classic espresso shot. Espresso is used to make many types of coffee beverages such as lattes, macchiatos and cappuccinos. These drinks have caffeine levels that can vary based on how many espresso shots are added. A good rule of thumb is that each 1-ounce espresso shot contains about 63.6 milligrams of caffeine, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. This is much higher in comparison to brewed coffee which contains 96 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce cup and just 12 milligrams of caffeine per ounce. If you're like me and are a daily coffee drinker with a sweet tooth, you might be wondering whether drinking coffee often is bad for you. On its own, black coffee is quite healthy because it is naturally loaded with antioxidants such as polyphenols and hydroxycinnamic acids, which help prevent aging and diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Here are some tips on how to make healthier coffee that still hits the spot. If your goal is to avoid adding processed sugar, opt for natural sweeteners such as honey that can curb the bitterness and elevate the flavors of your coffee.† Other low-sugar flavor additions to your coffee might include: Now that you know the various types of coffee roasts, have fun experimenting with different flavors and coffee blends!

on-the-menu,Food bank finds: black bean salsa,19-Oct-23,10:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-19/food-bank-finds-black-bean-salsa/,"Tucked in the back corner of the University Center's top floor, the Associated Students Food Bank serves the Gaucho community in the fight against food insecurity. Founded in April 2011, the A.S. Food Bank offers free canned goods, seasonal produce, grains, toiletries and more. Currently, the A.S. Food Bank serves over 3,000 students each week. Students can visit the food bank once a day and grab food on a first-come, first-serve basis. For the best produce selection, the food bank recommends coming early. Some limitations exist to ensure that all students can benefit (for example, students can only grab two of each produce item), but the free resource can make a huge impact in reducing grocery fees for students.† Founded in April 2011, the A.S. Food Bank offers free canned goods, seasonal produce, grains, toiletries and more, serving over 3,000 students each week. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus During the week of Oct. 9, the food bank displayed in-season produce like apples, bananas, lemons, chilies, tomatoes, potatoes, onions and more. On the other side of the room, shelves were stocked with non-perishable items like canned vegetables, dried grains, boxed food and toiletries.† As a student without a car to go grocery shopping with, the food bank is a vital resource for me. Plus, its convenient location on campus means I can stop by between classes instead of carving out time to take the bus to Albertson's. When I visit the food bank, I rarely have a plan or recipe in mind. Their constantly rotating supply of produce is unpredictable and encourages you to get creative. To make sure you don't grab anything you won't need, feel free to take your time scanning the shelves and formulate recipe ideas while you shop.† Looking at the shelves this week, I hardly needed to debate what to make. Between the canned beans and available produce, a bean salsa was meant to be. This recipe took 10 ingredients î I grabbed six from the food bank, had two at home and bought two at the store. The best part about this recipe is that the ingredients are completely interchangeable depending on what the food bank has in stock. If black beans aren't available, you can sub for kidney beans or pinto beans. I threw in green beans just for extra color and health benefits. I chose to buy a lime for the dressing, but lemons î which the food bank regularly stocks î work just as well for an acidic kick. Red onions can substitute for yellow onions, or you could forgo both if you can find a clove of garlic. Any kind of chili can work, or if you dislike spice, you can leave chilies out entirely. Salsas, by nature, are a grab bag of ingredients. No matter what you choose to include, this tangy and hearty recipe makes for a great snack or meal.† The best part about this recipe is that the ingredients are completely interchangeable depending on what the food bank has in stock. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Black Bean Salsa Yield: 6 servings Time: 15 minutes Ingredients: Directions: Follow @ucsbasfoodbank on Instagram for weekly produce finds, new items, and updated hours. For Fall Quarter 2023, the food bank will be open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from mid-morning to mid-afternoon.

on-the-menu,Bowltober: Dank Bowl Kitchen offers discount to celebrate 10th Anniversary,26-Oct-23,10:01 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-26/bowltober-dank-bowl-kitchen-offers-discount-to-celebrate-10th-anniversary/,"Dank Bowl's Tomato Basil Soup is Goldilock's porridge: a just right consistency, perfect balance of sweetness and acidity, which is all paired with cheesy, toasted bread. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus In a clever celebratory and promotional scheme, Dank Bowl Kitchen released a $10 deal for all bowls in the month of October, also known as Bowltober, to celebrate its 10-year anniversary.† An idea originating from the mind of one Daniel Dunietz in 2010, once a freshman at UC Santa Barbara and now its most dankù entrepreneur, Dank Bowl Kitchen has become one of the most popular food spots in Isla Vista for its affordable prices and irresistible variety of hot, comforting foods.† What sets Dank Bowl Kitchen apart from the others is its commitment to the freshness and authenticity of its food, all made from scratch and from local ingredients, no exceptions.ù I first had a Dank Bowl, lamentably, toward the end of my freshman year. I was shocked to discover that I could get a bread bowl at such a low price from somewhere other than Panera Bread (which I have not consumed since. After trying Dank Bowls, how could I go back?).† To take part in celebrating Bowltober, I dived deeper into its menu. With the endless array of options at the price of $10, I decided to sample one dish from each category: a soup, a pasta and a rice bowl. If I had a bigger budget, I would've had every item on the menu, but alas ¶ First up is the tried but true P. Daddy bowl. To be honest, before my intention of writing this article, I only ever got this bowl, and for good reason. Who can resist macaroni and cheese, with the added sophistication of chives, caramelized onions and pesto aioli? The crispy bread adds another layer of texture, which only enhances the overall flavor profile to engage all the senses and create a highly mindful state of consumption.† As an East-Coaster, the lack of fall colors here makes me subconsciously seek out oranges, reds and yellows in any form, and the tomato basil soup is a bright red bonanza to behold. There's something about a delicious soup that is irresistible, especially in the winter months when a cold is just nipping at your immune system and you yearn for the comfort of home-cooked food. This soup is Goldilocks' porridge: a just-right consistency, a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity (more on the tangy side, which I prefer), the fresh hint of basil, which all comes together with the crunch of cheesy, toasted bread.† And, what can I say about the Hangover Bowl that hasn't already been voiced by so many of us trudging out of bed on a particularly grueling Sunday morning? Incredible. The feel of the rice bowl, just like one of the pasta bowls, is a lot lighter and more enriching than I would've believed. The addition of an egg on top gives the rice an extra delicious gooiness which, combined with the kick of the jalape√±os, makes this dish a sensory delight. I would put this right under the macaroni and cheese bowls as the most filling since you can add more ingredients to make it into a carb, protein-packed meal. However, keep in mind: If you wait too long to eat the rice, the texture can be a bit unpleasant, so I would recommend slurping this dish up for the best food coma.† A side note: For all these dishes, I would recommend the regular bowl with bread on the side since I find myself usually left with a deformed and soggy bread plate by the end of the meal.† But for the more particularly ravenous eaters, here I say: go ham.† Ultimately, Bowltober reminds us of the incredibly rich history of our own I.V. î some traditions never die. From Buddha Bowls to Dank Bowl Kitchen, this eatery is likely to stay a crucial centerfold of this town's food culture, and a warm memory for all UCSB students to look back on and forward to in the coming years.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the October 26, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Foraging for wild blackberries and spooky stories,26-Oct-23,10:57 AM,['Maya Salem'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-26/foraging-for-wild-blackberries-and-spooky-stories/,"I was eight or nine years old, on a trip up the California coast, over cliffs and through forests, when I first learned how to forage. My father, whose unpredictable and free spirit seemingly burns brighter when outdoors, had suddenly bent down into the bushes by the side of a quiet creek. A few minutes later, he emerged, holding something in his hands, which he then dipped into the running water. Nestled in the cavity of his palms was a mound of glistening, juicy blackberries.† He explained how he had these all the time as a child in Lebanon. They would pick berries by the water source in the village, perfectly cooled by the running creek on late August afternoons. Though I was concerned that they were filled with poison, I tried some. There's a specific tang and liberating quality to wild blackberries, something that just isn't in the store-bought variety. Blackberries are an invasive species, always growing in close proximity to water, crawling through bushes and from crumbling river banks. It only takes one small piece of stem or rhizome for a bush to pop up, spreading its spiny arms, braiding itself into an impenetrable thicket.† If they're grown mostly in the shade, they're less sweet but carry an exciting rebellious and wild taste. In full sun, they're likely to be sugary and juicy. In partial sun and shade, there's no way to know how they might turn out î sometimes bland, sometimes brighter than both counterparts.† It is important while foraging to correctly identify both the physical characteristics of the plant and its leaves, in addition to the fruit. Female, wild blackberry brambles are characterized by their thorny vines, dark green, flat leaves with serrated edges and clumped fruit. For more information, visiting websites dedicated to identifying plants for foraging is always a good idea. Additionally, using a photo-capturing search engine can be useful in quickly gathering some information.† The good thing about foraging wild berries, specifically blue or blackberries, is that there are very few inedible ones. Around 90% of wild black, purple and blue-skinned berries are edible, with exceptions like the infamous nightshade berry, often mistaken for a blueberry.† But, in late October, blackberries have a slightly more spooky connotation. There's first the warning that comes after Michaelmas, celebrated on Sept. 29, following the fall equinox. According to British folklore, on Old Michaelmas Day, which falls usually on Oct. 10, the blackberry season should end and no more should be picked. The reasoning behind this is that this is the day it is said Lucifer fell from heaven and into a blackberry bush. Upon landing in its spiny brambles, he cursed the plant, spat on its berries, therefore making them unfit for further consumption.† There's also the matter of vampires. According to mythos, vampires have an unexpected obsession with blackberries, captivated even over the draw of blood. A vampire out at night may be halted by a blackberry bush outside your home and feel compelled to count every bramble, leaf then berry on the bush. And before the vampire knows it, the sun is rising and they have forgotten all about their victims inside the house.† Regardless of folktales, the blackberry season is an indicator that autumn is coming, if not already here.† There's nothing that binds the summer and fall seasons together like a baked treat highlighting star produce from both. The tang of blackberries and sweet apples under a warm cinnamon and walnut crumble is a sensory match made in heaven. Blackberry Apple Crumble† Yield: 1-2 servings Time: 30 minutes Ingredients: Directions: Since that fateful Pacific Northwest trip during my childhood, foraging for berries is one of my favorite treats about being in nature. I love any sort of fruit I can scrounge from plants. But when it's free, or in unlimited supply, I could spend hours pricking the pads of my fingers on thorny stems.† And, whether you believe that the devil spat on all blackberries after Oct. 10 or that they are a fruit to ward off vampires, I suggest you try a few from the bush.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the October 26, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

Anya Kennelly / Daily Nexus As the weather cools down and Halloween passes us, I find it important to appreciate the fleeting season of fall any chance I have. I want to drink pumpkin spice, go apple picking and most importantly, cook with fresh autumnal ingredients. Even though Thanksgiving, in all its culinary glory, is fast approaching, I want to celebrate the season and take advantage of the vegetables it has to offer. The first one that came to mind was butternut squash, which is such a versatile vegetable that is only in its best season in late summer and fall.† Why wait for Thanksgiving to have a good home-cooked meal that incorporates your favorite fall elements? Butternut squash is an amazing vegetable that needs more appreciation. It is so often left out of Thanksgiving meals in favor of the more famous gourd: pumpkin. Though I love pumpkin, it is the butternut squash that deservedly dazzles in this sauce.† I quickly got to work on deciding the best ingredients for the pasta and ran to the grocery store to grab the ingredients. This recipe is so simple: there is no dicing or stirring for extended periods. In fact, the blender does most of the hard work. I wanted something that I could make with my friends while having a fun night in î something that would match the vibe if we were feeling the cooler weather and having a cozy night in with a slice of pie. Butternut Squash Pasta Time: 35 minutes† Yield: 8 servings Ingredients:†† Directions: This recipe is a great way to eat vegetables and can easily be altered to be gluten-free with chickpea pasta. If you want to add protein to this dish, I added spicy chicken sausage one night when I ate it and it was a delicious combination. To really get in the fall spirit, pair the pasta with some apple cider, chai cookies and Gilmore Girlsù, and it's the perfect cozy fall night!

on-the-menu,Where to find Pan de Muerto in Santa Barbara to celebrate D√≠a de Los Muertos,2-Nov-23,10:00 AM,"['Stephanie Gerson', 'Kendra Martinez']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-02/where-to-find-pan-de-muerto-in-santa-barbara-to-celebrate-dia-de-los-muertos/,"Los Tarascos sells two variations of their pan de muerto: one with a dusting of pink sugar and one with sesame seeds. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus It's early November meaning it's time to eat bread of the dead, also known as pan de muerto! Day of the Dead comes with many traditions, and my favorite is going to the bakery with my mom and choosing which pan de muerto we are going to eat for this special day. But have you ever wondered about the origins of pan de muerto, a sweet, fluffy bread known for its circular shape and dusting of red sugar that is placed on altars for D√≠a de Los Muertos? It is common to think that pan de muerto was a tradition started by Mexicans. But the Aztecs started making this celebratory bread first. And it comes with a rather dark history. The story goes that the Aztecs would sacrifice a noble woman in order to appease the gods. They would use the blood of the woman and mix it with amaranth to make bread. Some legends say that the community would come together to eat the bread in a ceremony while other legends say that the priest in charge of the ritual would eat the bread to satisfy the gods.† Obviously that is not how pan de muerto is made today, and that's because the Spanish Catholic priests decided that the rituals were too barbaric. Instead, pan de muerto is now made with wheat and designed to look like a heart. It is sprinkled with some red sugar on top to represent the blood of the sacrificed woman. This type of bread is referred to as hojaldra, or puff pastry. Each region in Mexico has its own way of making pan de muerto. In larger states, hojaldra is the most common. In regions that have a more indigenous population, pan de muerto tends to be more unique and intricate.† Bakeries normally make a different type of pastry to represent and honor the children who have passed away. They make different shapes like chickens, bunnies and dolls to represent toys and put them on ofrendas (altars).† If you're looking to find pan de muerto for Dia de Los Muertos, which falls on November 2 this year, Santa Barbara is home to several panaderias that bake this special bread, including Los Tarascos Bakery and Deli on 314 East Haley Street.† Los Tarascos Bakery and Deli, owned by Enoch Brojas, sells upwards of 600 pan de muerto every year. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus. Owned by Enoch Brojas since 2007, the panaderia specializes in pan dulce, torta, specialty cakes and other baked goods. Yet it wasn't until three years into operating Los Tarascos, that Brojas started selling pan de muerto for the Santa Barbara community after receiving requests from multiple customers. Since then, the demand for the sweet, brioche-like bread has grown. Every year, the bakery sells roughly between 600 to 800 pan de muerto in late October and early November in addition to fulfilling specialty orders for events throughout Santa Barbara.† Brojas's recipe slightly differs from traditional pan de muerto sold in Mexico. Santa Barbara stores do not carry the orange essence used in Mexican pan de muerto, so Brojas adds in an alternative orange flavoring, butter and anise for flavor. Traditionally, the topping for pan de muerto is a dusting of sugar, but Brojas also wanted to offer a less sweet option, so he sells variations with a thin layer of glaze and sesame seed topping.† Los Tarascos's medium-sized pan de muerto are large enough to serve two people and were sold for the affordable price of just $2.50 per bread. We tried medium sizes of both variations of pan de muerto, relishing each bite of fluffy, slightly sweet bread, our fingers covered in pink sugar afterward.† Additionally, Los Tarascos is the only bakery in Santa Barbara to offer vegan pan de muerto, an item that was inspired by another restaurateur in the area. Dalan Moreno of Rascal's Vegan, owner of the vegan Mexican restaurant down the street from Los Tarascos, approached Brojas in 2020, asking him to sample one of his homemade vegan conchas. Brojas offered to adjust Los Tarascos' pan dulce recipe to be made fully vegan so that the bakery could supply vegan treats for Rascal's instead. Three years later, Los Tarascos has kept vegan conchas and pan de muerto on the menu, which they bake fresh every Tuesday. This year, Rascal's and Los Tarascos collaborated on a Vegan Pan de Muerto Relleno, consisting of a vegan Los Tarascos pan de muerto filled with homemade, non-dairy whipped cream and jam, which were served during the last two weekends of October at Rascal's.† Los Tarascos is only offering pan de muerto for a short time until November 3, so we suggest you celebrate D√≠a de Los Muertos and pay this hidden gem a visit. The tradition of eating pan de muerto is not only accompanied by a centuries-long history, but is also an essential part of celebrating Day of the Dead.

on-the-menu,Get a taste of home with this apple pie smoothie,9-Nov-23,10:38 AM,['Steven Bizzoco'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-09/get-a-taste-of-home-with-this-apple-pie-smoothie/,"Try adding allspice and ginger to spice up your smoothie with even more fall flavors. Steven Bizzoco / Daily Nexus In my family, the king of all fall treats is apple pie. Every year for Thanksgiving, I take on the task of making an apple pie from scratch. Putting time, effort and care into each step results in a delicious dessert staple of the season. While that may sound fantastic on paper, apple pie is a cruel mistress. Between making dough by hand and the grueling overnight wait before indulging, I'm only ever inclined to make it once a year. However, there is another way. If you don't want to buy a pie from a store (nor should you) and you don't want all the hassle of making one. There's a delicious treat that emulates the filling's flavor to quench your craving: the apple pie smoothie. I discovered this recipe in middle school. I had no baking experience at the time, but I wanted apple pie more than life itself. My mother is more of a cook than a baker, so my request for an apple pie in the middle of a particularly warm October was met with some understandable hesitance. The only kitchen tools I regularly used at the time were the microwave and the blender, so I had to get innovative. After finding the original recipe in a kid's cookbook, I prepared the ingredients, hit blend and was initially confused. The concoction was somewhat slushy-like, so I thought that was it. It's over. I'm not getting my pie until Thanksgiving and I'll just have to accept that. Life is cruel and unfair. Fortunately, I could not have been more wrong. The smoothie hit the spot, but the recipe had room for improvement. It's become a tradition for me to whip up a few apple pie smoothies every fall and I try to improve upon the recipe each time. I believe I have found my preferred blend of ingredients to most accurately capture the taste of apple pie filling. On top of that, it's healthy, simple and quick, making it a perfect treat. Time: 5 minutes Yield: 1 Serving Ingredients: Directions: The great thing about this recipe is that it's very open to customization. I personally love cinnamon, so I use far more than a sprinkle. Allspice and ginger are also welcome additions to the spices here. If you just hit the gym, a scoop or two of protein powder blends in perfectly. Just have plain Greek yogurt? Try it for a sour bite. Of course, no apple pie is complete if it's not √† la mode. Have some vanilla ice cream on the side or throw it in the blender with everything else to turn this smoothie into the ultimate refreshing treat that encapsulates the flavors of fall.

on-the-menu,Fad or flop: Is Crumbl Cookies worth the hype?,9-Nov-23,10:47 AM,"['Stephanie Gerson', 'Abigail Monti']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-09/fad-or-flop-is-crumbl-cookies-worth-the-hype/,"Crumbl Cookie prides itself on its inventive cookie flavors, such as Pink Velvet (far left), Brookie (center) and Banana Cream Pie (far right). Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The sun was setting and sugar cravings were setting in. There was only one thing for the two On The Menu editors to do: hop in a car, drive to Crumbl Cookies and attempt to drown our midterm anxieties in dessert. Crumbl Cookies opened a new location in Goleta at 5660 Calle Real last month. For those who don't know, Crumbl Cookies is a chain of bakeries that specializes in baking a variety of enormous cookies. Their rotating menu of over 200 cookies serves up five unique flavors each week, plus their classic Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunk cookie and some ice cream flavors. The cookie empire rarely repeats flavors, meaning that if you discover a drool-worthy cookie flavor one week, there's a very low chance that you'll be able to experience those flavors again in the foreseeable future. Originally based in Utah, Crumbl was founded in 2017 and now has over 800 stores across the United States. With over 7 million followers on TikTok and 4 million followers on Instagram, Crumbl Cookies is nothing less than a viral phenomenon. Their devoted fans are more than just followers: Crumbl enthusiasts live and breathe their cookies. And for good reason: their aesthetic photos and videos of gorgeously decadent cookies promise to deliver world peace with nothing but butter and sugar.† But do they really live up to the hype? We didn't think so. A single cookie comes with a hefty price tag of $5. Customers can also choose from box orders of four cookies, six cookies and twelve cookies. As the number of cookies increases, the price drops incrementally, but not much. We will admit that the massive size of these cookies could justify their high price point: each are easily five inches in diameter and loaded with toppings like icing, pudding, sprinkles, cookie crumbles and more. But are they too massive? With all their piled toppings, the cookies are too heavy and wide to bite comfortably into. Yet, inexplicably, Crumbl does not ask if you want forks or knives with your order. They don't even provide them in a public location to grab on your way out, ostensibly encouraging customers to eat their cookies at home. However, we were able to obtain a pair of utensils from the cashier after realizing there was no other feasible way to consume our order. But our request for napkins î another vital tool for eating these monstrous treats î went in vain: they didn't have any. An employee kindly offered us a sheet of paper towels instead and while we appreciated the gesture, their lack of napkins seems incredibly weird for a bakery that serves hazardously messy baked goods.† But our problems with Crumbl did not stop there. Adding to the inconvenience of eating their cookies was Crumbl's complete lack of seating. The store front, which looked like a sterile dentist's office with only a pink wall to break up the fluorescent-lit white paint, was rather small. Inside the door, there was only space for a short line for ordering, a spot for pick-up and a trash can. Outside, there was even less î in order to eat our cookies, we were forced to steal seating from their neighboring Thai restaurant.† But of course, the actual cookies were the main event. For our box of four cookies, the flavors we selected were Pink Velvet, Brookie, Milk Chocolate Chip and Banana Cream Pie. To our extreme disappointment, the special seasonal flavor of Pumpkin Cheesecake was sold out by the time we arrived to Crumbl at 6 p.m. We found it shocking that Crumbl did not anticipate the increased demand for pumpkin-flavored treats in the fall, but let this be a testament to the chain's popularity.† The Pink Velvet cookie's texture was very doughy and soft î perhaps too soft actually. While Red Velvet isn't a particularly strong flavor, Crumbl's interpretation of it was reminiscent of a glorified supermarket sugar cookie. From the soft cookie base to the very sweet frosting, we would struggle telling the Crumbl cookie apart from a generic grocery store one in a blind taste test, giving Pink Velvet a score of three out of five. The Banana Cream Pie also left us thoroughly unimpressed. Yet the Banana Cream Pie cookie was a literal hockey puck and impossible to eat without a knife and fork, defeating the main purpose of ordering a cookie in the first place. The cookie's thick base was nothing special, but things got weird once we moved on to try the chilled banana-flavored topping. Made of an indiscernible combination of ingredients, we didn't taste a hint of banana at all. Nonetheless, the creativity was there î shown in the interesting presentation and Nilla wafer topping î but flavor was absent, awarding the Banana Cream Pie cookie a two out of five.† Crumbl redeemed itself with its cookie variations that were the least adventurous, but for a company whose schtick is mastering the art of the unconventional cookie, this felt like a cop-out. The Brookie, which featured an even split of double chocolate and chocolate chip, was nothing special, but it was arguably good. The double chocolate flavor was weak due to its failure to include dark chocolate chips; the chocolate chip side was just okay. We did think the cookie's texture was the perfect balance of soft and crispy, resulting in a score of a three out of five.† Chocolate Chip is Crumbl's signature flavor, and it lived up to those expectations. We loved that it was larger in size than the others in the box. With each bite, we got bites of melty chocolate and a richer flavor profile than the other cookies. Chocolate Chip felt familiar, like the taste of your grandma's homemade chocolate chip cookies. The fact that Chocolate Chip was our favorite flavor made this entire experience a bit underwhelming. We would have rated this cookie a five out of five, but with it being such a foolproof dessert item that you can get at other bakeries for a better price, we reduced its score to a four out of five.† Overall, the On The Menu editors will likely not visit Crumbl Cookies again soon. While the bakery chain has redeeming factors, their high prices, take-out only atmosphere and unexceptional flavors did not live up to their promise.

on-the-menu,A guide to navigating Trader Joe's fall and winter seasonal specialties,16-Nov-23,10:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-16/a-guide-to-navigating-trader-joes-fall-and-winter-seasonal-specialties/,"In the name of food journalism, I bought every late fall and winter-themed snack and dessert item that intrigued me during a recent November shopping trip. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus How is the year nearly over? I couldn't grasp it, and neither could the cashiers at Trader Joe's, as we discussed our sadness over the sudden but solely seasonal discontinuation of my favorite fall Trader Joe's product: the Pumpkin Joe-Joe's. A fall spin-off of Trader Joe's beloved Oreo knock-off, the Pumpkin Joe-Joe's feature a lightly spiced cookie and the perfect ratio of pumpkin cream. But I guess there's no use in describing them now that they're off the shelves until next September¶ We tried to comfort each other over this loss by discussing the winter seasonal items in my cart. In the name of food journalism, I bought every late fall and winter-themed snack and dessert item that intrigued me during a recent November shopping trip. Honestly, I sort of blacked out and let my sweet tooth take over during this shopping trip. I wasn't looking to see if Trader Joe's had perfected store-bought cranberry sauce or boxed stuffing î I see these as the more banal of the seasonal items î or if the grocery store had the best eggnog for your upcoming holiday parties î sorry, but I despise nothing more in the culinary world than this off-putting, boozy concoction. Biases aside, I selected a wide variety of foods to review; that is, some cookies, some frozen treats, some candies and some fun beverages. The Trader Joe's Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Kettle Chips have a garlicky flavor, but one that feels less aggressive and pleasant to eat. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus During my conversation with the extremely friendly Trader Joe's cashiers, I got the lowdown on this year's holiday items, starting with the Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Kettle Chips, which the cashier noted to be a crowd favorite, with some customers buying bags in bulk every year. I was nervous to try these as I tried the chips' distant cousin, the Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Popcorn, and was faced head-on with the overwhelming flavor of crushed black pepper, garlic powder and nothing else. The chips are arguably better than the popcorn, with a similar garlicky flavor, but one that feels less aggressive and pleasant to eat. Serve these chips with a creamy dip, perhaps the Trader Joe's Vegan Caramelized Onion Dip, as the ultimate savory snack combination.† I was hoping to find a holiday-flavored, fun beverage and stumbled upon a few different options: a new Winter Sangria sparkling water flavor, a few non-alcoholic spritzers and a new coffee creamer. Trader Joe's sparkling water is never anything special so I kept my expectations for Winter Sangria low. I love how the grocery store's approach to translating an alcoholic beverage into a sparkling water flavor was to solely emphasize the main fruit used in the aforementioned alcoholic beverage: grapes. If you concentrate hard enough while you sip, you can somewhat taste, or trick yourself into tasting, hints of citrus. Other canned drinks I tried included the Sparkling Honeycrisp Apple Juice Beverage and Something Spritzy, a sparkling drink with citrus, cranberry and aromatic bitters. Upon first sip, the taste of Something Spritzy somewhat reminded me of a Mrs. Meyers holiday-scented hand soap but after a second sip, I picked up on the delightful blend of grapefruit and cranberry flavors. I also enjoyed the Sparkling Honeycrisp Apple Juice Beverage, especially considering that it could serve as a great non-alcoholic beverage option in place of champagne for holiday parties. Try adding a splash of this creamer to your daily coffee, chai or use it in place of heavy cream in a White Russian cocktail. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus The Non-Dairy Cinnamon Bun Oat Creamer was the highlight of this year's Trader Joe's holiday beverage selection. An iteration of their Non-Dairy Brown Sugar Oat Creamer, one of my favorite items since its launch in 2022, the Cinnamon Bun creamer truly tastes like cinnamon rather than just straight-up sugar. Try adding a splash to your daily coffee, chai or, if you want to get crazy, use it in place of heavy cream in a White Russian cocktail.† A Trader Joe's review would not be complete without mentioning their array of sweet treats. In November, the store still carries some items with the flavors of fall (maple, pumpkin, spices) while also introducing iterations of classic winter holiday treats. I had trouble finding self-control in my selection of dessert items during this shopping trip, but the Pumpkin Spice Madeleine Cookie Sandwiches, Maple Leaf Cookies, Candy Cane Chocolate Covered Almonds and Iced Gingerbread Squares caught my attention and felt the most inventive. The Madeleine cookies were pumpkin-y and quite delicious. Do they compare to my beloved Pumpkin Joe-Joe's? No, but they're a solid placeholder. Another sandwich cookie, the Maple Leaf Cookies feature a delicious, generous serving of maple-flavored cr√®me filling sandwiched between each cookie. The candy cane almonds lacked chocolate flavors but the hints of peppermint were present and it gave an unexpected twist on chocolate-covered nuts.† The Madeleine cookies were pumpkin-y and quite delicious. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus I was most excited for the Iced Gingerbread Squares, as gingerbread is the epitome of winter desserts. The package contains six squares of fluffy, spiced gingerbread elevated with sugary icing and sprinkles. Thaw the gingerbread squares at room temperature or heat them up in the microwave for a few seconds so† the icing can warm up. I could see this handheld, pre-portioned dessert being a huge hit at a potluck or winter gathering in place of the holiday sugar cookies that everyone will most likely bring.† During these final weeks of the year, it's easy to fall into the habit of eating the same foods that you've grown accustomed to eating in prior months. However, that gets boring and predictable after a while. Whether you're a dedicated Trader Joe's customer who finds joy in trying their latest creations or just enjoy the foods traditionally eaten around the holidays, I hope this guide gives you a few ideas on how to incorporate some new items and flavors into your rotation.

on-the-menu,Celebrating Native cuisine for American Indian Heritage Month,16-Nov-23,10:08 AM,['Nina Timofeyeva'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-16/celebrating-native-cuisine-for-american-indian-heritage-month/,"Urmi Mandal / Daily Nexus Many of the typical dishes we see on our tables for Thanksgiving (such as turkey and pumpkin) were common staples of the Native American culture, still, many dishes of the Native communities remain unknown to the majority of Americans.† Some of the popular Thanksgiving dishes are prepared similarly today as they were in Native American communities.umpkin, corn and meat were roasted, but over a fire rather than on a grill. The scope of preparation techniques and flavor combinations does not end there, however. This Thanksgiving, honor the harvest and traditions native to our land by preparing one of these traditional dishes! Succotash, †a vegetable and legume-based dish originating from the Native communities of New England, consists of a combination of crops known as the Three Sisters.ù The Three Sistersù refer to the method of planting beans, corn and squash together to utilize their symbiotic relationship. The corn stalks provide a structure for the beans to grow on, while the wide leaves of the squash shield the roots and soil from the sun, preventing the soil from quickly drying out. Succotash is prepared by cooking sweet corn with onions, lima beans, tomatoes and a variety of spices. This can be a simple, vegetarian dish to add a splash of color to your Thanksgiving table.† Cherokee bean bread, or tuya asuyi gadu, comes from the Cherokee community and is quite similar to the well-known Mexican tamales. To make this bread, corn flour (also called masa harina) is combined with beans, spices and sometimes some sort of fat, to form the filling. Corn husks are softened through steaming/boiling and then filled with the corn filling and tightly wrapped. These packets are then boiled for an hour to ensure the bread is fully cooked.† A simple and common dish originating from the Nez Perce, Umatilla, Warm Springs and Yakama nations is salmon prepared on cedar planks or stakes. Salmon was abundant in the many rivers that flowed through the lands of these Native communities. Not only did it serve as an accessible source of protein for these peoples, but it was also an indicator species, meaning that its population quantities served as a good marker of the natural environment in the region. A healthy salmon population signified the cleanliness of water sources and the density and diversity of various other species. Traditionally, the fish was skewered onto cedar stakes and cooked over an open fire, with the smokiness of the wood adding to the flavor of the salmon. To make this dish at home, soaked cedar planks can be used to achieve the same flavor profile in an oven or a grill.† A dish crucial to the survival of cold winter months was pemmican, a meat jerky often combined with berries. Pemmican can be made with any type of animal protein, ranging from elk to duck to salmon. Due to the dehydrated nature of this product, it could be stored for longer periods of time and had a high energy density, ideal for winter when fresh game, fruits and nuts weren't available. Today, pemmican can be utilized in instances for which its storage and nutritionally dense properties would come in handy î such as long hikes!† Another hearty dish well-suited for the winter season is Tanka-Me-A-Lo, also called Buffalo Stew. This dish is believed to have come from the Cherokee nation. It is made by stewing buffalo meat (although for at-home preparation it can be substituted for regular beef) together with tomatoes, celery, carrots, potatoes and barley. A fairly simple dish to prepare, cook this stew for your Thanksgiving table as a warm and comforting main course.† I consider succotash to be an autumn staple and make it every year, putting a personal twist on the dish by adding roasted squash. I also find that while cedar-smoked salmon may require some extra effort, the process always ends up being worth it and truly levels up the typical seafood entree. Corn husks and cedar wood planks can sometimes require some searching, but oftentimes specialty grocery stores can provide these. For these recipes, getting ingredients at a local farmers market, if available, can yield incredible flavors while also supporting your local farmers and small businesses.

on-the-menu,Ex-Subway employee reveals the tastiest sandwich combos,23-Nov-23,10:19 AM,['Katelyn Waters'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-23/ex-subway-employee-reveals-the-tastiest-sandwich-combos/,"Zoe Gonzales / Daily Nexus Subway is the perfect midday meal for students. With two convenient locations on campus î one at the Arbor and one at the University Center. As a former sandwich artist, I've had the privilege of crafting countless sandwiches, and I'm here to spill the beans (or should I say the toppings) on the ultimate sandwich combinations that will leave you perfectly satisfied.† Subway offers an abundance of its preselected combinations, but these are my own that I've constructed through my own trial and error. All of these sandwiches come toasted, as they should be. Be warned that these four sandwich names are not official Subway sandwich names. As long as you provide according to the numbered instructions, you will get the combo you desire. Tuna Melt Supremeù You can't go wrong with a tuna sandwich. While I worked at Subway, tuna was always a popular meat option, but few people made it how I like it. It's vital to toast the sandwich without the tuna. The price comes out to $8.90 on a six-inch, and $12.90 on a twelve-inch. Underrated Rotisserie Delightù This one is my favorite, and I order it almost every time. Chicken was never popular during my time there, which I still don't understand. It's easily my favorite meat served at Subway. This sandwich comes out to $8.90 on a six-inch portion, and $13.90 on a footlong. Classic Turkey Baconù Another popular meat option is turkey. Personally, I find turkey too bland on its own to have it on a sandwich. However, I think it perfectly pairs with bacon, which adds a nice salty flavor and texture. Order a six-inch for $10.80, or $14.80 for a footlong. Piece o' Pizza This one is tricky and some Subway workers may not agree to make it for you. But if you ask really nicely, you might have a chance. The bread itself is quite filling, enough to give Dominos or Pizza Hut a run for its money. With the toppings that Subway offers, the following is my favorite combination. If you're lucky, you'll only get charged for a pepperoni portion with mozzarella cheese. This comes out to $9.80 for a six-inch, and $14.80 for a twelve-inch. If not, you'll get charged the price of a meatball marinara, extra pepperoni AND extra mozzarella. In that case, it could be the most expensive sandwich on this list at a $11.70 and $16.70 for a six-inch and footlong respectively, so keep that in mind. Ordering from Subway for the first time is notoriously stressful, we all know this. Lots of people don't understand that the cost of the sandwich usually only depends on the size of bread and the type of meat you order. Every other veggie topping is free, minus the avocado. Hopefully this list gives you an idea of what you could order at Subway, down to the type of bread and the sauces.

on-the-menu,3 soup recipes to conquer the cold,30-Nov-23,10:34 AM,['Felicia Lo'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-30/3-soup-recipes-to-conquer-the-cold/,"Kimchi Soondubu Jjigae is a comforting soup full of flavors of garlic, sesame and gochugaru. Felicia Lo / Daily Nexus As the temperature starts to drop in Isla Vista, what else is better than a hot bowl of soup that can energize and soothe you? To combat the upcoming slightly depressing season, I wanted to share three of my favorite soup recipes that have gotten me through the cold and seasonal depression. With a bowl of rice or some pasta, these soups can supercharge you and give you the energy you need during gloomy days. You will notice a lot of the servings and ingredients are in ranges and not absolute numbers because home cooking is all about comfort and personal preferences. These are mine and what works for my friends and family. Some days you want more flavor, some days you want more protein and other days you want more richness, so take these recipes and make them yours in your cooking experiments!† Time: 5-10 minutes for prep, 15-20 minutes for cooking Yield: 4 servings Ingredients:† What would be awesome to add: Directions: The three most important flavor enhancers in this recipe are definitely the garlic, sesame oil and gochugaru (and/or gochujang). This recipe comes from countless experiments and validation from my roommates and family, and now it is your turn to find the perfect garlic, sesame oil and gochugaru combo that best suits your taste! Personally, I tend to overload it with garlic gochugaru until I reach my spiciness tolerance, but that's just me.† For the best eating experience, I highly recommend eating the soup with a bowl of rice, and piercing the egg yolk to mix with the soup and rice for the best creamy flavor.† Time: 15 minutes Yield: 2 servings as main course, 4 as a side.† Ingredients: Directions: Something I like to do to spice up the soup is add some cubes of salmon for the extra protein and umami. Most seafood goes amazingly well with miso, so tuna and many types of seafood also make an amazing miso soup.† Time: 10 minutes for prep, 25-35 minutes for cooking.† Yield: 1 per piece of chicken† What you'll need:† Directions:† For the best eating experience, serve with rice or some cooked pasta with grated parmesan (please grate this yourself and not use store bought grated parmesan because it will not melt into your soup).† When I cook this dish during any other time of the year, I omit the ginger, but this winter after getting sick, I found adding some slices of ginger into the soup made it a lot more hearty and comforting. It's more like a warmth that comes from inside your body. It made me feel more relaxed and my throat more soothed when I got a cold, so definitely try this out if you feel like you're about to get sick!

on-the-menu,The hundred-year history of candy canes and how to use them this holiday season,30-Nov-23,10:37 AM,['Nina Timofeyeva'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-30/the-hundred-year-history-of-candy-canes-and-how-to-use-them-this-holiday-season/,"Michelle Wu / Daily Nexus Candy canes have long been a beloved staple of the Christmas holiday season. But, have you ever considered where candy canes originated? Why do they have such a peculiar shape? And why the stripes? Legend has it that, around the 1670s, a choirmaster working at the Cologne Cathedral in Germany was having trouble keeping his young students quiet during long sermons. To solve this problem, he asked a local candymaker to make him some hard candy to hand out and appease the children. However, in order to connect these treats to the Church and its teaching, he requested to have them bent to represent a shepherd's hook, helping children remember the Biblical tale of the shepherds who paid their visits to the infant Jesus. He also hoped that the white color of the candy would represent the sinless life of Jesus.† The shape of this famous candy had taken shape early on, but the colored stripes are believed to have originated over two centuries later in the 1920s. Most likely, this was a marketing strategy employed by Bob McCormack, whose company Bobs Candies invented the Keller Machine, a machine that twisted long pieces of sugar candy and formed the tops into their signature hook shape. This allowed the company to increase its production of these candies from hundreds of candy canes per day to upwards of thousands of candy canes per day. To this day, Bobs Candies is the leading national producer, producing 1.8 million sticks of candy per day! Some theorize that the stripes were actually added long before McCormack and were used for communication among persecuted Christians. Others guess that the red stripes are meant to represent the blood of Jesus, and the candy cane's shape actually stands for the letter J.† The peppermint flavor's origin is not known, but some theories still circulate. In the 18th century, apothecaries would combine prescribed herbs with sugar to make medicines more palatable. Peppermint extract was often added to mask the flavors of the other herbs. Following the Civil War, the prices of sugar decreased, allowing candy makers to form a new market separate from that of the apothecaries, and peppermints became a popular candy.† Now that you're informed about the history of this holiday candy, here are some creative ways to use candy canes this holiday season:† This holiday season, treat yourself or your loved ones to some traditional, festive candy canes and appreciate their rich history to get into the festive spirit.

The two who showed attendees how to prepare both a vegetarian and a meat-based kimchi. Stephanie Luong, a third-year biochemistry major and author of the Asian Recipe Cookbookù pamphlet was inspired to share her recipes in an effort to encourage cultural diversity on campus and help students feel represented and capable of cooking their favorite cultural recipes. Luong focuses on encouraging cultural richness at UC Santa Barbara through improving food access and fighting food insecurity.
By hosting this event, I was hoping to show students that there are amenities and resources available to them to make UCSB their home away from home,ù Luong said..
In the introduction to her cookbook, Luong explains how she turns to food and cooking to connect with her cultural roots and her family, but most importantly, foster a sense of home. Co-leader Leanne Ly is a third-year environmental studies major and is currently working as a food, nutrition, basic needs & health equity intern at UCSB Health & Wellness. Ly hopes to help students feel their best at UCSB by encouraging cultural representation and accessibility to traditional ethnic experiences.
When you cook a family recipe, you are learning cultural traditions and connecting to your roots. When you share a meal, you are making connections and building relationships,ù Ly said in relation to how food and the process of cooking can allow people to feel connected and integrate their cultures. Luong's Asian Recipe Cookbook explores Asian grocery stores and restaurants in Goleta. I hope that when you try these recipes, you're not only cooking a wonderful meal, but you're also taken back to your home î a place or feeling of community and inclusivity,ù Luong wrote.

I sampled both of the drinks on their holiday selection: the sugar cookie latte and the peppermint mocha latte. My drinks were made with whole milk and the full sugar amount, but the baristas can substitute for non-dairy or low-fat milk to your preference and can change the sugar amount if it is not a pre-made mix. My favorite of the two was undeniably the sugar cookie latte. The taste and smell were exactly its namesake: it tasted like a diluted sugar cookie, but the overall taste of a milky sweet coffee was slightly more powerful. The drink transported me to a winter paradise without being overly sweet or giving me a headache, the fault of many fall and winter sweet treats. The aftertaste was simple and syrupy but light. For dark roast coffee lovers, this might not be the drink for you, because it had bright and mild acidity and was far more fragrant and sweet than bitter. The drink earned a solid 8/10.† The peppermint mocha latte was less enjoyable. I am more partial to the mixing of chocolate and peppermint than coffee and peppermint, and the latte solidified my opinion, presenting a drink where the flavors fought each other, with none providing an appetizing victory. The peppermint was overpowering, and the aftertaste lingered, leaving a metallic, slightly artificial taste. However, the drink became more palatable as I progressed, as the intensity of the peppermint became more subdued. The drink, in short, tastes like a dissolved Altoid in a vanilla latte. I rated this holiday drink as a 6/10.† Despite the drink menu being a hit or miss, Tenaya Market & Eatery will always be there for a quick fix. I recommend checking out their other beverages and what the rest of the shop's seasons have in supply.

The struggle to return to pre-pandemic customer numbers led many beloved establishments that had become I.V. landmarks to close. According to a 2022 report conducted by Hayes Commercial Group on the Santa Barbara County real estate market, average rent for commercial spaces in Goleta increased in 2022 15% compared to the 5-year average, contributing to fewer commercial leases signed in late 2022 in Isla Vista. Some closures were met with deep dismay from the local community, such as the shuttering of one of Isla Vista's few bars. Amidst these departures, several new restaurants arrived î some alumni-owned, others with preexisting locations in Santa Barbara County î expanding the selection of dining options for students.† In early January, I.V. dive bar The Study Hall closed after a 26-year-long run. The space has since remained vacant, yet rumors of a new business taking its place sparked after the storefront's lights were on and construction noises were heard from the street in mid-December. Eateries that operated for less than a year also left I.V. in 2023, including Checos. After only nine months of operation on Trigo Road, the taco shop, which held its grand opening in October 2022, was replaced by Pueblo del Pollo in November 2023. Pueblo del Pollo was originally located on upper State Street before closing in 2022. This I.V. newcomer's menu is a fusion of Mexican and Indo-Pak cuisine with most items centered around their fire-grilled chicken. A go-to spot for UCSB students to grab burgers and pints, Rockfire Grill closed this month. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Another I.V. staple, Rockfire Grill, closed unexpectedly this month. Rockfire, known for its fries, burgers, wings and karaoke, opened in November 2018. As of now, it's unclear which new restaurant will take over the space at the corner of Pardall Road. Meanwhile, some restaurants kept their cuisine but rebranded and elevated their previous offerings.† Pizza My Heart branding left 6533 Trigo Road and officially reopened in January under the name I.V. Pizza Pub and ownership of Doron Friedman, owner of I.V. Bagel Caf√©. The pizzeria features Pizza My Heart classics as well as a brunch menu with pizza bagels.† Vietnamese restaurant Pho Bistro closed in June and was replaced by Asia 101, which is owned by UC Santa Barbara alum and Mojo Teahouse owner Boxi Wang. Pho lovers can still get their fix at Asia 101 along with quick bites such as spicy chicken wings.† I.V.'s fourth coffee shop, KOZY Coffee, opened on May 19 on Pardall Road. A UCSB alum-operated business, the coffee shop features a full coffee and tea menu, pastries and rotating, seasonal drinks.†† This past June and July, Maria's Tacos and Social Eats opened their doors.† Maria's Tacos, the fifth taqueria in I.V., features a pared-down menu and rotating specials.† Social Eats, I.V.'s first mini food hall, allows customers to choose from offerings from six different restaurants with options ranging from vegan burgers to poke bowls.† Oakberry Acai opened its second location in Santa Barbara County, dishing acai bowls and smoothies. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus And despite a winter chill in the air, a√ßai bowl caf√© OAKBERRY A√ßa√≠ opened its doors on Pardall Road in December.

on-the-menu,10 international holiday cookies,6-Jan-24,12:16 PM,['Nina Timofeyeva'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-06/10-international-holiday-cookies/,"Simone Mansell / Daily Nexus Hundreds of years ago, our distant ancestors celebrated the winter solstice by holding lavish feasts before the colder temperatures set in and limited the crop and game yields. During the Middle Ages, the growing prominence of Christianity replaced these solstice celebrations with Christmas throughout Europe. Deciding not to compromise a good excuse for a celebratory meal, the traditions of gathering around to enjoy food during these holidays were maintained.† Around the same time, thanks to the Silk Roads, novel spices were being spread around the world. Black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg were not the only novelties to make it to the kitchens cooking up these holiday feasts: dried fruits such as dates and apricots also became newly acquired ingredients that could be incorporated into desserts. While these foreign additions were expectedly costly for the average family, even butter and sugar were commodities that families could only afford on special occasions, such as the holidays. Having obtained these rare ingredients, households baked special treats to please loved ones and celebrate. Cookies held the advantage of being easily shareable and giftable. And so, cookie making around the holidays became a common tradition in households all over the world. Here are 10 traditional holiday cookie recipes from countries around the globe:

Anise pizzelle The Italian anise pizzelle cookie originally comes from the Abruzzo region and is said to be the oldest known cookie (said to have originated during the 8th century)! These cookies are made using a pizzelle iron (similar to a waffle iron) which give the cookie its beautiful snowflake-like appearance. Springerle shortbread Another impressively old cookie recipe is the German springerle shortbread. Created during the 14th century, these cookies originally touted images from the Bible to educate the illiterate about religion. This effect was first achieved by using springerle molds, which have since been replaced by the springerle rolling pin, allowing bakers to work quicker, although at the expense of requiring greater arm strength. The images on the cookies have also evolved to represent not only biblical scenes but scenes of celebration of births, weddings and holidays. Brigadeiros It wouldn't be a true Brazilian party if brigadeiros weren't present! These round, chocolate sweets were born when women in Brazil had just gotten the right to vote in 1932, and some wanted to create treats to bring to meetings in support of their favorite candidate, Brigadier Eduardo Gomes. Even though he didn't end up winning the election, his campaign gave Brazil one of its most famous sweets that continues to bring smiles throughout holidays and celebrations today. Green pea cookies Chinese New Year is a festivity that can boast a variety of celebratory cookies, but one unique and simple recipe is green pea cookies. The shape of these cookies symbolizes ancient Chinese coins and convey wishes of wealth and prosperity. The green pea flour used in this recipe not only gives these cookies their vibrant color but also allows individuals with nut allergies to enjoy them. Nan-e nokhodchi The Persian New Year, Nowruz, is celebrated with a multitude of delicious sweets, one of which is the nan-e nokhodchi. The main ingredient of these cookies is chickpea flour, making them enjoyable for gluten-free individuals as well. Combined with pistachios and cardamom, these aromatic cookies are traditionally shaped into clovers. Soetkoekies In Africa, Christmas isn't associated with snowflakes and pine trees but rather the beach and late-night parades. And to celebrate, soetkoekies are enjoyed as a sweet treat. A well-known recipe from South Africa, soetkoekies are very simple sugar cookies, easily achievable by even a novice baker but unmatched in their buttery, crispy glory. Pepparkakor A holiday cookie list wouldn't be complete without gingerbread, but did you know that an equivalent has existed in Sweden since the 1300s? Pepparkakor is the thinner version of its gingerbread cousin, and the two share many characteristics. This specific cookie is flavored with a variety of spices and sirap (a molasses-like syrup with a caramel taste). A pepparkakshus is a cookie house made from pepparkakor cookies and decorated with icing and candies.† Ko≈Çaczki Ko≈Çaczki are traditional cookies hailing from Eastern Europe, although the exact country of origin is debated. Some claim these cookies were first made in Czechia, while others maintain that these are Polish treats. But regardless of their nationality, these cookies are sure to bring joy to any holiday meal. These cookies can be filled with jams of any variety (strawberry, blueberry, apricot, orange or pineapple), dried fruits, poppy seeds or sweet cheeses. They are often presented in a recognizable envelope-like shape and dusted with powdered sugar. Alfajores South America, especially Argentina, celebrates with alfajores, or caramel sandwich cookies. Said to have originated during the 8th century, today these cookies are a popular treat throughout South America and internationally for tourists, signifying this cookie's cultural significance. Various regions of Argentina can be distinguished by the recipes of their alfajores. Some are made from sweet corn flour while others are filled with regional wine, but the appreciation of this cookie is consistent all around. Stained glass cookies Last but not least, British stained glass cookies will certainly usher the holiday spirit into any home. Colorful and customizable into any shape and color, making and hanging these cookies is a fun activity that can be enjoyed with family and friends. These cookies are made to impress and can be used as fun, edible Christmas tree decorations. If you're looking to expand your baking repertoire beyond typical sugar and gingerbread cookies this holiday season, give one of these international recipes a try and get a taste of celebration from another culture within the comfort of your home.

on-the-menu,Bringing bagels to the desert: Yetz's Bagels opens shop at Dank Bowl Kitchen,18-Jan-24,10:39 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/bringing-bagels-to-the-desert-yetzs-bagels-opens-shop-at-dank-bowl-kitchen/,"The Worksù bagel sandwich comes packed with freshly cooked eggs, melted cheddar cheese and crispy bacon. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Despite packing mac and cheese-filled bread bowls since 2010, Daniel Dunietz, UCSB alumnus and founder of Dank Bowl Kitchen, is on a mission to bake the best bagels in I.V. Yetz's Bagels, coined after Dunietz's nickname, opened inside Dank Bowl Kitchen just last week. Open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m daily î or until their fresh-baked bagels sell out î the pop-up caters to a breakfast and lunch crowd. Midday, the restaurant undergoes a menu switch, leaving Dank Bowl Kitchen to handle the evening shift.† The inspiration for Yetz's Bagels struck last fall after Dunietz took a trip to the East Coast. Anytime I visit family in New York, I purchase a dozen bagels from a local shop and pack them into my luggage to feed my bagel cravings for a week. I have always longed for a bagel shop in Santa Barbara that could simply come close to the chewy, crunchy heaven that is a perfectly baked New York bagel,ù Dunietz said. I had the epiphany that if anybody was going to create the perfect bagel it would have to be me.ù While the idea for Yetz's Bagels was born recently, Dunietz has always been a bagel enthusiast. I've been perfecting the òtopping' portion of a bagel since as long as I can remember. One of my favorite things to do as a teenager was invite friends over so they could try my bagel creations,ù he said. But bagel making is more than just a hobby for Dunietz: as the son of Polish Jewish immigrants, he notes that the activity is embedded deeply into his family traditions and heritage. Despite the many other breakfast joints in I.V., Dunietz claims the community is in a bagel desertù and he's the man to turn that around.† I realized that if I couldn't find a decent bagel in town I had no choice but to bake it myself, and set out on a mission to produce a bagel that would rival even the most established New York bagel shops,ù Dunietz said. So what makes Yetz's Bagels different? The answer lies in the process. From the moment the yeast and the flour mix, our bagels are prepared with the utmost care and attention to detail in order to ensure the end product is mouth watering perfection. We don't cut corners. We take every step in the bagel making process seriously and prepare them the same way they have been prepared for centuries, going back to my roots in the Polish Jewish community,ù Dunietz said.† I started hand-rolling the dough on my kitchen counter, tweaking the ratios, knead time, proof time, yeast type, boiling and baking times, basically every variable that you can imagine, continuously striving for the perfect bagel. After months of experimenting, I am confident my bagel is hands down the best bagel in Santa Barbara, if not the entire Central Coast.ù† The menu has no shortage of handmade, New York-style options, offering plain, everything, poppyseed, sesame, garlic, onion and cinnamon crunch-flavored bagels. Their sandwich menu is limited, currently featuring only four options, yet comprehensive enough to satisfy any crowd. The Gaucho, Yetz's Bagels' most iconic menu item, features bacon, egg, cheese, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo or pesto aioli.† I have a whole list of bagel creations that I think the IV community would love, but that will all come in time,ù Dunietz said.† Following Dank Bowl Kitchen's legacy of creative combinations, we can only anticipate Dunietz bringing exciting new topping options to the breakfast crowd. What Yetz's Bagels lacks in options, it makes up for in value. A single bagel with schmear costs $4.25 and a classic egg and cheese sandwich only costs $6. The most expensive item on the menu, The Deluxe î featuring lox, chive cream cheese, tomatoes, onions and capers î totals for $12. The same options (or similar, in regards to The Deluxe) at IV Bagel Cafe compare closely, costing $4.44, $6.99 and $12.76, respectively.† While the prices are similar, the quality is leagues apart. Prioritizing quality, Dunietz and his team take no shortcuts. Unlike other I.V. establishments, microwaved eggs are out of the question at Yetz's Bagels. Cooked on the griddle and perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper, Dunietz serves up eggs that are fluffy, warm and î most importantly î fresh.† Yetz's Bagels also offers a comprehensive drink menu, featuring unique choices like Honey Milk Tea, Caramel Cold Brew, Iced Matcha Latte, Lemon Drop Black Tea and Strawberry Basil Lemonade. Once again, Dunietz delivers reasonable prices: the cost for a 16-ounce drink ranges from $3.25 to $4.25. However, the drinks are pre-prepared in large batches, which prevents any customization. Despite utilizing no advertising beyond an 8.5 x 11 inch Bagels Bagels Bagelsù sign posted in the store's front window, Yetz's Bagels is already drawing a hungry crowd. With Dunietz's mouth-watering bagel recipe, word-of-mouth might just be all he needs to establish himself as the bagel mogul of I.V. Make sure to stop by earlier in the morning for the widest selection of bagels, as rising demand might leave your favorite flavor in short supply. I think that once you've tried one of Yetz's Bagels, there is no going back,ù Dunietz said.†Visit the restaurant's location on Embarcadero Del Mar to put Dunietz's claim to the test.

on-the-menu,Kick off winter 2024 with KOZY's seasonal menu,18-Jan-24,10:47 AM,['Kendra Martinez'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/kick-off-winter-2024-with-kozys-seasonal-menu/,"The addition of honey to a traditional vanilla latte creates a uniquely flavored drink that's perfect for those with a sweet tooth. Kendra Martinez / Daily Nexus KOZY Craft Coffee has become a staple for most UC Santa Barbara students by being one of the few coffee shops in town. Not only do they serve amazing drinks, but they also provide a super cozy ambiance that makes for a great study spot when you can find a seat. The dimly lit coffee shop is located in the heart of I.V. on 6560 Pardall Road. Drop in at any point in the day between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., and you will find the coffee shop busy with students waiting for their drinks or doing work on the outside patio. KOZY offers quite a wide selection of drinks along with an array of pastries to satisfy any sweet treat run. Not only are their drinks great, but the KOZY staff are incredibly friendly and provide quick service. As a coffee enthusiast, I frequent the cafe many times a day and have tried several of their drinks, including their limited-time holiday menu, and here are my honest reviews:† Honey vanilla latte 10/10† This signature creation is the best drink KOZY has to offer. A twist on the classic vanilla latte, the honey vanilla latte's unique sweetness keeps you coming back for more. When I first tried the drink, I did not know what to expect, but it certainly blew me away and instantly became my new go-to coffee order. The honey adds enough spunk to an already great latte but does so in a way that enhances the drink's flavor profile. If you are looking for something new to try that's still within the comfort zone of a traditional latte, KOZY's honey vanilla latte is the drink to order.† Vanilla latte 9/10 Speaking of vanilla lattes, I can say that the vanilla latte at KOZY is one of the best ones in I.V. It's not too sweet, but it is still flavorful. The right amount of milk and syrup allows for the coffee flavor to come across. Because KOZY uses its own coffee beans to make the espresso and makes its own vanilla syrup, the drink is unique while still being a classic. It's the standard go-to if you want something that you can trust will always be good.† Raspberry mocha 9/10 Mochas are generally not my favorite, but I was intrigued by the combination of raspberry and mocha because I love chocolate and raspberry together on a cake. I was not disappointed. It had a rich chocolate profile, reminiscent of a hot chocolate. Combine that with the delicious raspberry syrup, and it makes a delightful drink on a cold evening.† Peppermint bark mocha 10/10 My fear of peppermint-flavored things is that they will taste too much like toothpaste, but when done right, peppermint is one of the best flavors paired with coffee. KOZY definitely knew what they were doing and made a perfect peppermint mocha. The peppermint is subtle enough that it doesn't completely overpower the mocha and coffee flavors. The peppermint crumbs add a nice crunch and little flavor kicks. It's definitely my favorite on the holiday menu.† Nutcracker cold brew 8/10 Cold brew can be a tricky drink to get right, but KOZY has nailed their recipe for a smooth, silky and rich coffee. The addition of the hazelnut cold foam added an additional kick of flavor and made for a beautiful, picture-ready drink. It was a refreshing, nutty cold brew and is perfect for those looking for a slightly more caffeinated, tasty cup of coffee. Snickerdoodle latte 7/10 This one is definitely for the cinnamon coffee lovers, and it's not too overpowering. The first sip has a subtle hint of cinnamon and it's not until after that you're hit with the full cinnamony flavor. While I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon, this drink was still an enjoyable and flavorful coffee.† KOZY is great for morning coffee, afternoon coffee, evening coffee or, really, all-day coffee. They also offer a selection of teas and matcha drinks for those who don't love coffee. Whether you want to try their fun creations or stick to classic coffee drinks, there's something for everyone. Their seasonal menu is still available, so if you've made it to the end of this article, it would be silly not to go order a drink.

on-the-menu,Flu vs. Food,25-Jan-24,10:00 AM,['Nina Timofeyeva'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-25/flu-vs-food/,"Honey's anti-inflammatory properties provide your immune system with extra support. Nina Timofeyeva / Daily Nexus With stress levels rising during the start of winter quarter and the weather starting to turn colder, catching a cold may be imminent. Fortunately, we can turn to certain foods to help combat illness and strengthen immune systems. Vitamin C is a popular flu-fighting supplement. This vitamin's function is to aid in the production of collagen, a protein that forms connective tissue, supporting the body's nervous, bone, immune and blood systems. It also stimulates the activity of white blood cells which are responsible for fighting infections in the body. Early on, even prior to the official discovery of vitamin C, some nutritionists found that citrus fruit rich in vitamin C could prevent people from getting ill with scurvy, an extremely common and lethal disease for sailors between the 1500s and 1800s. However, tests studying the effects of vitamin C supplementation have found that this element does not have a huge influence on preventing the flu and colds. But, it was found to shorten the duration of sickness and decrease the intensity of symptoms. So, overall, even though vitamin C might not be a true preventative of the flu and colds, it is still vital to one's overall health, and ensuring that it is present in your diet can have many beneficial outcomes such as helping speed up the recovery process from an illness. Often it is said that vitamin C exists in abundance in citrus fruit, and many people typically associate vitamin C with sour-tasting fruits. Interestingly enough though, strawberries and bell peppers actually contain more vitamin C than oranges! Try this Strawberry Citrus Salad to bring back some brightness during the darker evenings and make it feel like summer again while getting your daily dose of vitamin C. Another crucial component of a healthy immune system is vitamin D. Though research regarding the supplementation of vitamin D on the frequency and intensity of respiratory infections did not find major effects of prevention or remediation in the general population, it was concluded that those with a vitamin D deficiency did benefit from supplementation in decreasing the flu and colds. Vitamin D deficiency becomes increasingly common during the winter months as less sunlight is available, which is the key mechanism to the body's production of this vitamin. Once again, ensuring that your body produces and receives enough vitamin D will help maintain a strong immune system. Naturally consumed vitamin D can be absorbed from foods such as mushrooms, fatty fish and eggs. Additionally, many milks and juices are now supplemented with vitamin D, so consider switching out your regular drink with a fortified one during the cold and flu season. This Baked Fish With Mushrooms and Ginger contains not only Vitamin D but also ginger î another incredible food known to prevent sickness. Ginger has antiviral and antibacterial properties, which can stop unwanted infections from entering and spreading in the body. It also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, which can help support an immune system that may be battling against already present infections. Your green tea or matcha-drinking habit can also boost immunity. Green tea not only makes for a delicious drink but can also help your body's immune system. Containing catechin, a powerful antioxidant, green tea has been found to prevent and aid in the remediation of influenza. Green tea can also assist the body in getting rid of cellular debris and bacteria. If you find that you have already caught a cold, drinking green tea (especially with honey) can soothe a sore throat, help the immune system fight against an infection and ensure that you're staying hydrated. This Bigelow Green Tea COLD BUSTINGù Recipe is sure to have you feeling cozy during the colder days and will give your immune system everything it could possibly wish for. Combining green tea with honey, ginger, cinnamon and turmeric, this recipe gives an even greater boost to the already potent tea. Honey is known to possess antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, as well as acts as an anti-inflammatory, providing great support to the immune system. Turmeric is an incredible anti-inflammatory antioxidant that can ease symptoms that come with the flu and colds.

on-the-menu,"Kimchi fries, wonton soup and more: Alumni-owned Asian fusion restaurant ASIA 101 serves up cozy dishes to keep you warm all winter",25-Jan-24,10:02 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-25/kimchi-fries-wonton-soup-and-more-alumni-owned-asian-fusion-restaurant-asia-101-serves-up-cozy-dishes-to-keep-you-warm-all-winter/,"Toppings such as lime wedges, green onion, bean sprouts and Thai basil leaves added big flavor to the wonton and tom yum soups. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus. Replacing longtime Isla Vista eatery Pho Bistro, which had a 16-year run at 903 Embarcadero del Norte, ASIA 101 opened to the public last August. The Asian fusion restaurant is a new member of the Mojo family which also includes boba shop Mojo Caf√© on 6530 Seville Road. The pair of restaurants is owned by UC Santa Barbara class of 2015 alumnus Boxi Wang, who first opened Mojo Teahouse in August 2018 after noticing I.V.'s lack of quality milk tea and fast, casual Asian cuisine. During Mojo's five years in business, they've experimented with their tea selection as well as a variety of savory quick bites, ranging from rice bowls to kimbap. Yet over the years, Mojo Teahouse phased out its well-loved popcorn chicken and kimchi fries to focus on expanding their drink menu and other Asian specialties like Vietnamese b√°nh m√¨ sandwiches. At ASIA 101, Mojo's fried favorites are back along with a limited menu of noodle soups and rice dishes. On a blustery winter night as I sat in my freezing apartment curled up under three blankets dangerously close to my space heater, nothing sounded more appealing than a large bowl of warm soup. So, I ventured out into the cold to pick up a few of ASIA 101's soups and appetizers to warm the bellies of my friend and me. We decided to order the wonton noodle soup, creamy tom yum noodle soup and kimchi fries. Once I arrived back home, we assembled our noodle soups by adding our noodles, protein and toppings to the large containers of broth and dug right in. We took our first few slurps of soup. I'm feeling kind of full, which is not an easy feat coming from an empty stomach,ù my friend said. Granted, he was high when he said this. What he meant was that the portion sizes were generous, and the soups were very satisfying, with each soup capable of serving more than one person. The wonton soup features a clear beef broth, boiled shrimp cooked to perfection, a generous amount of shrimp wontons and bok choy. ASIA 101 serves this soup with egg noodles, but customers have the option to swap for different noodles of their choice, including vermicelli or rice noodles; in hindsight, I should have swapped my noodles. The egg noodles in my soup were very chewy and perhaps a little undercooked, but they eventually softened after floating around for some time in the broth. I liked that this soup came with some bok choy stalks, even though they were a little difficult to wrestle into a singular bite. On their own, the broth and wontons were lacking in flavor, but this deficit was improved once we added in the complimentary but optional toppings. These toppings included lime wedges, green onion, bean sprouts and Thai basil leaves, as well as the additional hoisin sauce and sriracha chili sauce packets that were in our to-go bag. Tom yum soup is known for its rich and creamy coconut milk base that's combined with lemongrass, Thai basil and Thai chilies. My friend and I are pescatarians and chose shrimp again as our additional protein for this soup, but other protein options for soup include rare steak, beef flank, beef brisket, meatballs, combo beef, chicken and tofu. We preferred the pho rice noodles that were included in this soup and cooked to achieve a pleasantly soft texture. I personally wished that this soup came with more vegetables like the bok choy pieces in the wonton soup. While the prices for these soups are on the more expensive end ì $13.99 each plus $3 to $5 depending on your choice of protein ì the portion sizes reflected the price. While surprising, the combination of shredded kimchi, melted mozzarella, mayo and hot sauce on French fries was delicious. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus What we were most excited about were the kimchi fries, which from the description on ASIA 101's menu scared me a little bit î the fries featured a combination of shredded kimchi, melted mozzarella, mayo and hot sauce. Mozzarella and kimchi in one dish felt wrong. But the only thing that was wrong about these fries was my original opinion about them (and maybe their slight sogginess). The fries featured a delicate blend of sweetness and spice. Out of all of the items we tried from ASIA 101, we liked this appetizer the best for its creativity and interesting flavors (My friend noted that the fries tasted even better while high, and I took his word for it.) ASIA 101's noodle soups are a great value for the price, packed with your protein of choice and reminiscent of your favorite Asian comfort foods. Yet for times when you're feeling more adventurous, this I.V. establishment has appetizers to surprise your taste buds that you can't find anywhere else in the area. With cold weather expected for Santa Barbara's forecast for the coming weeks, I'll continue to use this weather to try out the rest of this restaurant's cozy soups and intriguing fried tapas.

on-the-menu,"Sunshine, tacos and Bruce Lee: A day at Hana Kitchen",1-Feb-24,10:30 AM,['Katelyn Waters'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-01/sunshine-tacos-and-bruce-lee-a-day-at-hana-kitchen/,"Each ingredient in Hana Kitchen's teriyaki mango tacos played its role without overshadowing the others. Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus Westward from campus cycling through Pardall Road are familiar names like Starbucks and The Habit Burger Grill, unflinchingly standing and bustling with gauchos. But amidst these popular eateries, Hana Kitchen, though somewhat enigmatic in its decor, stands out. The minimalist interior features a cryptic message, Do you remember when¶ù and a looming Bruce Lee portrait, creating an atmosphere both intriguing and perplexing. Despite my assumptions of Hana Kitchen being a standalone establishment, the intrigue was reason enough to explore further. Raised in South Korea, I, like many of my Asian peers, approach the concept of Asian fusionù with skepticism. Often, the addition of soy sauce to a dish does not justify the label. Setting aside preconceived notions, Hana Kitchen's teriyaki mango taco became the focus of my culinary exploration, priced at $4.50. I'm not a fervent enthusiast of mango, even in its artificial form. Because of this, the prospect of pairing it with teriyaki sauce left me cautiously optimistic. I enlisted the company of a good friend, Mimi Mogen, for a Friday lunch, unsure if I could conquer the taco solo. As Mimi indulged in their best-selling chicken bowl, served with a grilled chicken leg on a bed of white rice, broccoli, cabbage and carrots, we patiently waited for our orders. The teriyaki mango taco, presented on a corn tortilla adorned with tomato, onion and cilantro, offered a visual and aromatic spectacle.† The initial bites revealed cilantro as the dominant flavor, generously sprinkled as the final touch. Those averse to cilantro should take note. To my relief, the mango wasn't overpowering in any capacity. The true star of the dish, Mimi and I unanimously agreed, was the impeccably marinated grilled chicken. Its savory-sweet profile complemented the other ingredients, creating a satisfactory blend of flavors and textures. The teriyaki mango taco turned out to be a delightful surprise, with the mango exhibiting a more neutral taste than anticipated. Each ingredient played its role without overshadowing the others. Do be warned that the tortilla doesn't hold for long under the weight of the taco. Without a fork and a to-go box, there wouldn't have been a way to eat without a mess. After getting halfway through the taco, it's easier to consume as a teriyaki mango salad. It is vital to note that Hana Kitchen does a 2-for-1 special for Taco Tuesdays. Future visits are on the horizon to take advantage of this deal and reevaluate this intriguing Asian fusion dish. I recommend visiting on a sunny day like I did to fully appreciate the outdoor seating and ponder the significance of the cryptic wall messages.

on-the-menu,"I A√ßa√≠ you! Oakberry serves up healthy, flavor-packed Brazilian delights for all",1-Feb-24,10:54 AM,['Josh Rhodes'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-01/i-acai-you-oakberry-serves-up-healthy-flavor-packed-brazilian-delights-for-all/,"The rich taste of peanut butter and the crunch of coconut and granola paired well with the light, fruity flavor of the acai. Josh Rhodes / Daily Nexus Tucked away at the edge of Isla Vista's commercial avenue, Pardall Road, lies the town's newest hidden gem. The hit chain, Oakberry, originates from Brazil and has stores across the globe. Their December opening offers Isla Vista residents a taste of the country's culture and a healthy fast food option, which I knew I had to go taste and review as soon as possible. Oakberry was founded in 2016 by Georgios Frangulis and Renato Hairdar, who dreamt of changing the fast food landscape and its unhealthy perception; their menu offers robust, delicious fast food with its customer's wellbeing and lifestyle in mind. The chain quickly spread around its native homeland of Brazil after the a√ßa√≠ phenomena took the South American country by storm and quickly opened over 100 stores domestically before expanding abroad in 2018 to the United States and Europe.† The a√ßa√≠ berry is a delicious purple fruit originating from South America î more specifically, from the marsh and swamp lands in Brazil. Tasting similar to an infusion of blueberry and grape, the berry has been a staple in the diets of river-based communities along the Amazon River and offers a unique taste of the country that other foods can seldom hope to contend with. The fruit grows naturally on the A√ßa√≠zeiro palm tree native to the forest and is harvested by locals and sold around the country. The a√ßa√≠ production cycle is core to the economic sustainability of indigenous riverside communities î like the Kambeba tribe î along the Amazon and helps protect the rainforest from deforestation as the trees do not need to be cut down in order for the fruit to be harvested. Rightly so, the a√ßa√≠ tree has gained the nickname the Amazon Guardian.ù† Oakberry purchases their a√ßa√≠ berries from local harvesters in the northern river community of Brazil known as Santa Izabel do Par√°, where they go through several sanitation treatments and quality selections in order to guarantee their delicious taste and texture. Oakberry's a√ßa√≠ formula is 100% natural and doesn't feature dyes, artificial preservatives or sugar syrups, as it seeks to preserve the natural taste and benefits of the a√ßa√≠. In addition, their product can be enjoyed by anyone with dietary restrictions as it is certified by the Food and Drug Administration and United States Department of Agriculture, organic, vegan, dairy-free, halal, gluten-free and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point-certified.† Oakberry's comfy atmosphere includes two hanging rattan chairs. Josh Rhodes / Daily Nexus The morning after a night out on the town, I wanted a refreshing delicious treat to help me perk up and get ready for my day. I was delighted by my glimpse into Oakberry as I was greeted by two hanging rattan chairs by the doorway which my butt would later fall in love with and randomly ran into some friends. Already regulars to Isla Vista's Oakberry installment despite the store opening in December, we all placed our orders and sat down, eagerly awaiting our food. †The menu mainly features smoothies, bowls, snacks and drinks with a few other products not listed on the menu available for purchase. Bowls and smoothies come in three sizes: classic (12 ounces), works (16 ounces) and the Oak (24 ounces) and can cost between $10 to $20, including unlimited free toppings. I purchased a works a√ßa√≠ bowl for $13.50 with banana, strawberry, blueberry, granola, coconut, chia seeds, peanut butter and cacao nibs and an Oakberry passion fruit-a√ßa√≠ kombucha. The brand makes their own unique flavor of kombucha using their signature a√ßa√≠ berries that I felt obligated to try. †The colors of the different ingredients and the signature deep purple of the a√ßa√≠ immediately struck me as I got my first glance of my order. As I sunk into the first spoonful, I was greeted by an amalgamation of different fruity flavors and more crunchy bites from the granola and cacao nibs. My friends and I describe the a√ßa√≠ taste as similar to a bag of frozen mixed berries from the stores with an extra helping of ice: a delicious sorbet-like treat. I especially enjoyed the rich taste from the peanut butter, granola and coconut after I mixed my bowl's ingredients together, which highlighted the light fruity taste of the fruit extremely well. I can't help but agree with one of my friends' offhanded comments about the flavor of her bowl, which she happily described as an explosion in my mouth.ù While I deeply enjoyed my work bowl, I wasn't immediately impressed by the taste of my Oakberry kombucha. The drink was more carbonated than I expected, and while the taste eventually grew on me, I don't think mixing the fruity flavor of the drink with my a√ßa√≠ bowl was the best duo. However, I am not an avid consumer of kombucha, so some might like the combination of the bubbly taste with the fruit. I definitely would not knock off trying it at least once since I did enjoy the drink eventually. †All in all, I really enjoyed my first taste and visit to Oakberry. The a√ßa√≠ bowl was delicious and hit the exact sweet yet rich and protein-full meal I was craving after a night out. However, I did feel a little unsatisfied by how much I ended up paying after my first visit. While the unlimited free toppings î featuring additions like granola, cacao nibs, whey protein, peanut and almond butter, fruit and more î and the organic and freshly imported a√ßa√≠ from Brazil did help me explain the pricing to myself, I definitely did not need a drink to complement my bowl, and in the future I will bring my own water instead. Also, If I could change my order, I would add sweetened condensed milk to my bowl î a secret menu topping î which my Brazilian friend told me is how many in her country like to eat it. I am giving Oakberry a solid 8/10 rating, and would absolutely recommend visiting Isla Vista's newest food destination as soon as you can!

on-the-menu,The best (and worst) I.V. restaurants for first dates,8-Feb-24,10:11 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-08/the-best-and-worst-i-v-restaurants-for-first-dates/,"Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Picture this: it's Friday night, you've asked someone in your class to go on a date, and you have twenty minutes to pick the least cringey restaurant to take them to. Ensue panicking! Isla Vista isn't exactly the most romantic setting for small talk over good food. Even worse, eating in town introduces the possibility that you might run into someone you knowîa first date nightmare. But if you don't have a car, your options are limited. Don't despair! As a senior who has gone on more than a few (good and bad) dates within the confines of downtown Isla Vista, read on for my list of the best (and worst) first date locations.† Let's start with the worstîthe following are in no particular order. All are bad options. Don't say I didn't warn you. Domino's Pizza Unless you and your date are die-hard Domino's fans, this date location sets the bar for all future dates extremely low. What's your plan for date number two? A trip to Jack in the Box? The only acceptable way to indulge in Domino's is after getting it delivered to your home past 10 p.m. because everything else was closed and your inebriated brain chemistry is fixated on carbs. Not to mention the nightmare of navigating what to order. Asking someone what their go-to pizza preference is before truly getting to know them is just asking for trouble î too many problematic toppings, like anchovies, pineapple and olives, invite the opportunity for icks to form. As a rule of thumb, you're better off choosing somewhere that offers silverware.† Wingstop I have one word for you: messy. While you and your date might both love digging into a tray of saucy chicken wings, neither of you will feel comfortable asking about each other's childhoods while soiling two dozen napkins with BBQ sauce. Even worse, Wingstop's outdoor seating on the corner of Pardall practically guarantees that you will run into someone you know î an uncontrollable variable that might end up with you and your date's photo spammed in the group chat or an embarrassing story that completely sours your date's opinion of you. Deja Vu Cafe Deja Vu Cafe is inadvisable for the same reasons as Domino's: if you aren't currently influenced by taste-bud-altering substances, you shouldn't be there, and you definitely shouldn't be there with someone you're trying to impress. Deja Vu Cafe is like a vampire: it shouldn't be seen in broad daylight. Trust me, there's something about sitting under those fluorescent lights and listening to rap hits from three years ago that just brings out the worst in people. If you bring your date to Deja Vu Cafe, I guarantee you can kiss your good first impression î and your chance at actually kissing your date î goodbye.† Now on to the three best restaurants in I.V. for a first date. Not only do all of these restaurants provide a cute and comfortable atmosphere, but they also serve up quality food.† SocialEats As I.V.'s only micro food hall, SocialEats has it all. The inside space is aesthetic, well-lit and perfect for private dining. Plus, the outside patio provides a sunny spot for an afternoon lunch date that's just far enough removed from the bustle of Pardall Road. Even better, their diverse menu makes sure that no matter your date's eating preferences, they're bound to find something appetizing to order. And, of course, SocialEats serves drinks: there's nothing like a nice cocktail or pint to help stave off awkward silences and keep the conversation going. Caj√© Coffee Roasters If you and your date are only free to meet during the morning or early afternoon, Caj√© is your go-to option. While coffee dates sometimes get a bad rap, there are plenty of benefits: most notably, grabbing coffee with someone is low-key and low-stress. And, if you want something more substantial, Caj√© offers plenty of breakfast and bakery items to tide you and your date over. Plus, their patio provides a semi-public atmosphere that takes the pressure off meeting up with a near stranger while providing just enough succulents to block your date from the view of passersby. Hot tip: if things go well, keep the conversation going by taking your drinks to-go and walking to the beach entrance on 65 block.† Sizzling Lunch Sizzling Lunch might be one of the most underrated food spots in I.V. Nestled next to the Amazon lockers on Trigo Road, Sizzling Lunch serves up dozens of shareable appetizers, customizable Japanese street food entrees and a variety of hanabi cakes for dessert. With available reservations, waiters and exclusively indoor seating, Sizzling Lunch is the closest you'll get to a true sit-down restaurant experience in I.V. Honorable mention: I.V. Drip In my opinion, I.V. Drip is the nighttime equivalent of Caj√©. Grabbing dessert is a perfect idea if you're looking for a quick, low-stakes date option after dark. I.V. Drip offers cookies, ice cream, cupcakes and more, ensuring satisfaction for anyone's sweet tooth. I recommend ordering a variety of baked items and splitting them between you and your date. I.V. Drip also offers a full drink menu, including coffee, tea lattes and hot chocolate. Keep in mind that chocolate is an aphrodisiac (if you know what I mean).† By following this easy guide, you can save yourself from committing any fatal first date faux pas. I.V. has plenty to offer if you know where to look! If you're still a little nervous about running into someone you know, remember that ordering food to-go and setting up a picnic along the bluffs is a reliable option, especially during sunset hours. You've got this! Just remember, no matter where you choose, use a napkin, turn off your phone and î of course î tip your cashier.† A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the February 8, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Lunar New Year Festival 2024: Monterey Park's Foodie Wonderland,8-Feb-24,10:40 AM,['Valerie Fu'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-08/lunar-new-year-festival-2024-monterey-parks-foodie-wonderland/,"The stinky tofu, served in a savory broth with pickled vegetables and red peppers, was one of the best dishes at the event. Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus With the Year of the Dragon on the horizon, Lunar New Year festivals are being held all across the country in celebration of the luckiest year in the Chinese zodiac. The Lunar New Year falls on Feb. 10 in 2024, but the extravagant celebrations can begin as early as the middle January.† One of the most popular festivals in Los Angeles is the Lunar New Year Festival, held in Monterey Park from Jan. 28 to Jan. 29, an event that boasts thousands in attendance over the weekend. I had the opportunity to attend this festival last year and I was even more hyped to experience the foodie paradise of Monterey Park again in 2024.† On a blazing Sunday morning, I made the trek from Isla Vista down to Monterey Park, a neighborhood in Los Angeles with a large Chinese-American population. As I drove through the residential streets, I could see vertical red banners flanking doorways and paper dragons gracing porches, both traditional decorations to welcome the new year. After a tumultuous adventure (finding street parking), my partner and I walked into the middle of the bustling festival. Delicious smells of the street stalls filled my nose and I was suddenly reminded that I had skipped breakfast for the occasion.† The first stall that caught my eye was one advertising their black stinky tofu. Stinky tofu, despite its unappetizing name, is a common delicacy originating from Taiwan. The black variant is commonly sold in mainland China in a spicy and flavorful broth. I love stinky tofu so I bought a large bowl, amounting to about $15. The spongy tofu soaked up the savory broth, which also included pickled vegetables and red peppers to cut through the heaviness of the dish. The spice was actually quite mild and the tofu was less pungent than I thought it would be. Nevertheless, it was one of the most filling dishes of the day and helped slake my appetite for the meantime. The next food stall we went to was one selling lamb and beef skewers. Many stalls were selling skewers but we chose one with an open grill so we could observe the process of cooking. The stall we visited sold six skewers for $10, a deal that seemed too good to be true until I noticed that the meat only went halfway up the skewer. We walked away with six lamb skewers, which were seasoned with salt, cumin and a dash of red pepper powder. The lamb was cooked to perfection with juicy, fatty parts sandwiched between lean meat. My main qualm was the minuscule portion size, though it made sense due to the popularity of lamb over beef.† We wandered around until we met up with a mutual friend who was really craving a Taiwanese-style, fried chicken cutlet. My mouth watered at the suggestion of a juicy chicken cutlet fried to perfection and seasoned with salt and pepper, a fan-favorite street food option in Taiwan. I remembered seeing a food stall advertising just that, so I led my foodie compatriots through the crowd to claim our bucket of chicken. We ordered the classic salt-and-pepper seasoning option with some spice on the top, which came with a sweet-and-spicy sauce and ranch to pair with the fried chicken. The white meat was coated and fried with tapioca flour, giving the crisp breading a slightly mochi-like texture on the inside. The dish was a crunchy delight that I could see becoming dangerously addictive.† After the deluge of meats, I was craving a refreshing drink. Another classic street food option is fresh sugarcane juice, which was thankfully being served at a multitude of stalls. The drink that we ordered came out to a whopping $10, a highway robbery. It was tinged brown, a departure from the usual green, leading us to think that honey or other syrups were added to it. It was sweeter than other sugarcane juices that I've had in the past. Regardless, it was still an invigorating refreshment that served as a great palate cleanser.† Tanghulu, a fruit skewer encased in a sugar shell, is traditionally made with hawthorn berry. Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus The last order of the day was a dessert that has made its fame on TikTok: the tanghulu. Tanghulu, a dessert originating from China, is a fruit skewer encased in a sugar shell. The most traditional fruit is the tart hawthorn berry, but modern variations include strawberries, mandarin oranges, grapes and blueberries. The crunch of the sugar gives way to a fresh juicy fruit that delights the senses. We searched high and low for a hawthorn skewer priced under $10, but we settled eventually for the $6 strawberry and grape skewers. They were beautifully sweet and satisfying, crunchy and juicy: the perfect end to a perfect day.† The food options at the Monterey Park Lunar New Year Festival were delicious, yet understandably pricey. The classic Taiwanese and Chinese street food options among modern Asian food variants in sunny Los Angeles made for a wonderful foodie adventure that I would be excited to experience year after year. Happy Year of the Dragon, and good luck and prosperity to you all! A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the February 8, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,"Bananas today, gone tomorrow?",15-Feb-24,10:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-15/bananas-today-gone-tomorrow/,"Lauren Bryant / Daily Nexus Layers. Multiple of them can be found in onions, people, paint on walls ¶ too complicated, a lot to reveal, often deceptive once you chip away at them. But you know what is almost exactly what it is within as it is on the out, only one layer to uncover? Sidestep, make way, here comes the banana. Andy Warhol didn't have his love affair with this soft and sweet yellow fruit because it was complex or complicated, but because it was mundaneù: a symbol of the everyday man, a consumer staple, the quintessential pop of color in everyone's kitchen, a fruit enjoyed by babies and baby boomers alike.† The fruit that we've all gone bananas for arose from a tough, green fruit chock full of black seeds, genetically selected for and bred over centuries to become the edible one we know today. The banana has been a cornerstone of many cultures, like my own. Us Indians make use of every part of the banana: skin, leaves and all. We use the leaves as disposable plates, in formal and informal settings alike, we make curry with the peel, we even use its flowers, stems and sap as ayurvedic remedies for diabetes and countless other ailments. However, the banana didn't make it big in the Western world until a scrappy 18-year old immigrant Samuel Zemurray got his hands on this yellow pot of gold in the mid-19th century. From then on, the banana was the star of the world's stage, and it has been that way ever since.† As of today, the banana has amassed a following demanding the production of over 100 billion a year, generating $8 billion, filling the bellies of millions of people worldwide. The different varieties mixed in more combinations than Fleetwood Mac, leading to today's over 1000 breeds of banana. The reach of the Cavendish is the widest: the breed was designed to withstand overseas export and now constitutes the majority of the bananas exported to the U.S. and Europe. In other countries, many different breeds of banana are consumed regularly, but this is not the case in the States.† America's reliance on the Cavendish breed presents a horrifically prophetic vulnerability with the acceleration of the spread of the Tropical Race 4 strain, or Panama disease, which has been devastating banana populations for the past three decades. The disease reached the South American hub of production, Colombia, for this fruit in 2019, and we can expect a global shortage of bananas to occur within the next couple of years, unless something is done. And so, the simplicity of the banana that we've come to love might just be the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back. The only solution? Diversify, diversify, diversify. Scientists like Dr. Fernando Garc√≠a-Bastidas are working to isolate genes in the banana that can withstand the Panama disease and, with this knowledge, change the way bananas are bred to keep them alive and thriving.† One day, when we walk into grocery stores we will be greeted with the sight of a spectrum of bananas, perhaps forfeiting our favorite swatch of yellow, going slightly over-budget, but that is a price that I'm willing to pay. Are you? While you ponder all that you have read here today, why not try the simple banana snack recipe below? Take your time, bite by bite, and appreciate that light, sweet and starchy flavor we've come to love, and hopefully is here to stay. † Frozen Peanut Butter Banana Slices Yields: 2 servings Time: 10 minutes prep + overnight (as frozen as you'd like) Ingredients: Directions: This recipe takes no time to prepare, and can be made in bulk and stored for future cravings. I highly recommend it frozen, but I have found just putting peanut butter on the banana slices to be equally delicious. Enjoy!  Œî  Œî Earn $280 an hour.

on-the-menu,Indulging in delight: The irresistible offerings of Kin Bakeshop,15-Feb-24,10:21 AM,['Felicia Lo'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-15/indulging-in-delight-the-irresistible-offerings-of-kin-bakeshop/,"Kin Bakeshop rotates their donut and drink flavors daily, announcing each menu drop on their Instagram. Felicia Lo / Daily Nexus Each bite of Kin Bakeshop's mochi donut has the perfect texture and balance of innovative flavors. It's addicting. One bite after another I question my own sanity. I remember my reaction to my first bite of one of Kin's donuts: eye closed, fist clenched, breath stopped, trying to find the balance between inhaling the entire donut and slowing down to savor each bite.† Located at the Turnpike Shopping Center, Kin Bakeshop crafts mochi donuts, brioche donuts and a special set of drinks inspired by Asian desserts. The interior of the shop features a minimalistic yet stylistic design î modern and cozy. Stepping inside is like opening my eyes to a new world that is not often seen in the Santa Barbara scenery. Every couple of days, I excitedly check Kin's Instagram account for new menu releases of their brioche and mochi donuts: always a new flavor and always a new texture with a hint of innovation. Although they have a few staple flavors, such as the cinnamon Nutella mochi donut, I can always count on Kin to create flavor combinations that I've never seen before or never thought would work. They keep me on my toes, and keep me hooked and never bored, always having me lurking around their account and always planning my next visit even though my wallet begs me not to.† Granted, the first two times I tried to get donuts at Kin were failures. The first time I went was after I had seen a friend post about it, arriving at the shop at 3:30 p.m., before the closing time listed on Google Maps, unaware of the customsù of going to Kin. In hindsight, that was a stupid move because even now, getting there at 9:30 a.m. could mean not getting any donuts at all. I thought I had learned my lesson the second time I went, and I was met with a line that probably would have translated into over an hour of waiting for donuts.† So here's what you have to do: you've got to plan your Kin visits in advance, wake up early enough to get there before they open if you want to be certain that you get the flavors you want, especially if they are the popular ones. On weekdays, except for Fridays, there usually isn't a long wait. Strolling in the early afternoons might even win you a donut of your choice. However, if you want to get a specific pastry from Kin on Fridays through Sundays, then you better plan ahead or you will be met with a two-hour-long line. But is all this worth it? Getting a pastry had never been this much hassle until I became hooked on Kin's mochi donuts. Every time I take a bite, my slightly sore legs from standing in line in the early mornings make it worth it. There's a reason Kin is a weekly destination for me and for many others. As a citrus fanatic, their recent lemon yuzu and mandarin tanghulu (yes, they put actual pieces of tanghulu on the donuts) mochi donuts were some of the best desserts I've had in a long time. Without a set menu, it is impossible to give a recommendation item to get at Kin, but there were some memorable flavors that I would like to see again in the future: hibiscus, Chinese almond cookie, Korean sweet potato and many more. I hate to say this, but you just had to be there, or on their Instagram the day they released the menu. It's always different, and it's always changing. Although the star of the show is the donuts, Kin also has an intriguing menu of drinks with various Einspanners, cream tops and tea lattes of Asian flavors. Now, I haven't tried one yet (which means I will eventually), but they do look exquisite, and they look their price. A friend who has tried their matcha Einspanner said that Kin's version of the drink is a matcha equivalent to the teas CHICHA San Chen makes.ù And having been to CHICHA San Chen, a chain tea shop honored by the Michelin-backed International Taste Institute in 2021, I have to say that I now have high expectations of Kin's drinks. Similarly to how they craft their pastries, they often have specialty drinks that they offer only on certain occasions. Even though getting a piece of Kin's delights is sometimes more cumbersome than going to a regular down-the-road bakery, you can always stay up-to-date through their Instagram account. Whenever a new flavor of donuts or drinks is launched, you can count on them to make a timely announcement. Even when you are right outside waiting in line, they send out updates on their pastry counts and offer hot drinks on the windier days. Although I would say that efficiency is not their strong suit, given the often long wait times, their consideration and care for their customers make up for it.† Kin's attention to detail and the thoughtfulness they put into their craft and business really shine through regarding how they interact with their customers online and in person. You can see how owners Tommy Chang and Will Chen really care about their employees and the community that they've built through the messages they post on their Instagram account, sharing their gratitude to everyone involved in their ambitions. Besides being a bakery, they are truly an inspiration on how to run a community-focused business. A version of this article appeared on p. 15 of the February 15, 2023 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Happy Vegantine's! I.V. Community Center's Vegan Holiday Food Fair,22-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Josh Rhodes'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-22/happy-vegantines-i-v-community-centers-vegan-holiday-food-fair/," Ahhh, February. It's a month that many single people dread, and one that couples cherish because of one particular holiday: Valentine's Day. As a single man whose mental backpack was overloaded from stress and angst from midterms, I wasn't especially receptive and happy to see the sea of people flooding my classes and campus with their red, holiday-themed clothing, posting photos on Instagram stories of them and their partners. But as the saying goes, love was in the air, and despite what some may say, that holds especially true to those people without a partner. It's important to show yourself some self-love on holidays like these, because you deserve it. What better way for myself and others to treat ourselves to our well-deserved self-love than to get some delicious food from Isla Vista's Valentine's Day Vegan Food Fair. Organized by the Isla Vista Community Services District, the de facto government body of Isla Vista, the event took place on Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, from 3- 6 p.m., boasting free vegan food, soap and flower bouquets. Isla Vista has so many awesome vegan food options, and we wanted to put on a community event that brought together local vegan food and just promoting local eating in general,ù said senior environmental studies major Molly McGee, who worked to organize and execute the event as an event intern for IVCSD. For a while people have talked about how they want to see a vegan food fair¶ so we decided to put it together on Valentine's dayù. Eager to fill up our tummies, I invited my friend to join me at the fair expecting good food and free souvenirs. What we didn't anticipate was how popular the event would prove to be. Upon entering the Isla Vista Community Center, my friend and I were immediately greeted by vibrant red and pink streamers, heart-shaped cutouts, music and other great decorations in celebration of Valentine's Day. Vegan food and flower stalls from local Isla Vista businesses like the I.V. Food Co-op and OAKBERRY A√ßa√≠, served the event attendees food and fun. The vibrant mess hall lively with people, music and the smell of food was truly amazing to behold given the building's† unassuming, monotone facade. My friend and I, excited by what we saw, quickly began to explore the venue. Despite us arriving about an hour late, we were surprised to discover that practically all of the food booths were serving the last morsels of vegan delights they had brought with them to the event. Furthermore, all that remained of the promised flower bouquet station were the lowly husks of discarded flower stems and petals scattered around the floor. Slightly disappointed, but all the more motivated to get some food in our stomachs, my friend and I quickly went around and piled samples from all the stalls that still had food onto our flimsy paper plates, and moved ourselves outside to review our hauls.
 We started off strong by devouring an everything bagel from one of I.V.'s newest culinary residences, Yetz's Bagels. Despite the bagel being cold, my friend and I tore right into it with gusto, savoring each bite. Having partaken in a few bagels since my time in Isla Vista from the .V. Bagel Cafe, I was delighted by the solid taste of the bagel î definitely at least a 7/10. I feel that I need to try a fresh warm bagel from both places before making an informed decision about which one I like more, but as of right now I am still a die-hard I.V. Bagel Cafe loyalist. I decided to follow up by sampling some vegan cheeses from UCSB's Advocacy for All Animals (AAA) club. As a skeptic of most vegan dairy substitute products, I was stunned by how good the flavor of the cheese was. Kite Hill's vegan cream cheese was a solid 8/10 in my book as the flavor was barely discernible from the real thing. I am also giving an 8/10 to the Sharp English Farmhouse cheese from Miyoko's Creamery which was very soft and tasty î super enjoyable. I rounded out the fair with some home-made hummus and guacamole from the I.V. Food Co-op booth. A longtime favorite store of mine, I wasn't let down by the quality that the co-op normally serves as both toppings were bursting with flavor. The hummus was silky smooth and refreshing, whereas the guacamole had a more vibrant taste. I am rating both 8.5/10. All in all, I was very happy with my experience at IVCSD's Valentine's Day Vegan Food Fair and will definitely be looking out for similar events in the future. For anyone else interested, IVCSD's community calendar can be found on their website! A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the February 22, 2024 version of the Daily Nexus.

Stephanie Gerson / Daily Nexus This February, Black-owned businesses and community organizations are collaborating in several different ways for Black History Month under Santa Barbara County's theme of Black History: More Than A Month.ù From soul food and live performances to cultural activities and limited-time food fundraisers, there's no shortage of ways to celebrate and uplift Black culture and community in Santa Barbara this month and all year long.† Throughout the month, Soul Bites Restaurant, an establishment with a menu of comforting soul food favorites at 423 State Street, has been hosting an event series organized by the Santa Barbara Black Culture House. The Santa Barbara Black Culture House was founded in 2020 by Santa Barbara residents Darrell M. McNeill and Sally A. Foxen-McNeill as a pop-up space to celebrate Black history, culture and art. Curated by the McNeill's, the events in the organization's annual Black History Month series have included poetry slams, book readings and live music performances. The final installments of the series include music by the Funky Neighbors on Feb. 24 and a live reading of Richard Wesley's play òThe Talented Tenth' by The Robey Theatre Company on Feb. 25. Both events will be held from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. and are free to the public.† Santa Barbara bean roastery Dune Coffee Roasters has partnered with Healing Justice Santa Barbara, a nonprofit organization focused on fostering resilience for the African diaspora and other marginalized communities along the Central Coast, on a special coffee blend that serves both your tastebuds and the community. The limited edition Healing Justice SB Whole Bean Blend features a rich combination of dark chocolate and stone fruits and is available for purchase at any of Dune Coffee's locations and online throughout February. With every purchase, 40% of the proceeds go directly to Healing Justice Santa Barbara. The organization is also hosting its annual, sold-out Black is Beautiful Gala & Fundraiser on Feb. 23 to raise funds for their programs which currently include conversations with Black community members and BIPOC community organizers, documenting Black history through installations and storytelling sessions for Black youth featuring children's books that center their stories. On Feb. 27, the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District is hosting the annual Forward Ever, Backward Never event from 4-8 p.m. at the Isla Vista Community Center. This community event honoring Black History is a collaborative event with the UC Santa Barbara Black Student Union and Office of Black Student Development. The evening's programming features live music, free food catered by Soul Bites, raffles, Black history games, an indigenous drum circle by Groupo Tolteca Izkalotl and rock painting. Juneteenth Santa Barbara, an organization that plans an annual Juneteenth celebration in downtown Santa Barbara, is extending its dedication to uplifting the local Black community through culinary-centered fundraising all month long. Spanish tapas restaurant Loquita, located in the Funk Zone, is serving a new cocktail with the mission of Juneteenth in mind named Los Quinteros,ù attributed to Luis and Maria Quintero, who were trailblazers from Africa and settled in Southern California in the late eighteenth century, making a considerable impact on the area's community and culture. Also in collaboration with Juneteenth Santa Barbara, La Paloma Cafe is featuring the Iqualesù cocktail on its drink menu this month, which consists of nosotros reposado, brucato amaro chaparral, amaro angeleno, orgeat, pineapple and lime.

on-the-menu,An ode to cottage cheese,29-Feb-24,9:00 AM,"['On The Menu Editor', 'Nina Timofeyeva']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/an-ode-to-cottage-cheese/,"Adding cottage cheese to scrambled eggs makes a protein-dense, fluffy breakfast. Whether it's the texture, the taste or the debate of whether it should be considered cheese, cottage cheese often elicits polarizing responses on both ends of the spectrum. But despite its lack of prominent marketing and general tendency to get put on the back shelf, cottage cheese has recently started to gain popularity. The main reason driving cottage cheese to its social media trendinessù is its impressive nutritional profile. A 100 gram serving contains around 11 grams of protein î more than an egg! It's also a great source of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium and sodium. Adding into consideration its probiotic traits, it may as well be declared a superfood.ù Cottage cheese has always been this nutritious, yet it has only begun to gain popularity recently. A good guess as to why this is happening is that people are now discovering new ways to incorporate cottage cheese into meals as a protein supplement. Some recipes transform it to such an extent that you'd never know it was even there.
 For those who have never tried cottage cheese before, the taste of it can be compared to that of less tart plain yogurt but perhaps a bit more salty. The exact flavor varies by brand, but overall, think of it as a milder plain yogurt with added texture. So whether you're looking to add some protein to your diet or you're just a true and loyal fan of cottage cheese, give these recipes a try, and perhaps you'll be impressed by this humble cheese. Blending cottage cheese eliminates its curd-like texture, leaving it smooth and creamy. The first time I saw cottage cheese stepping into the spotlight was no other place than TikTok. Here, cottage cheese was transformed into a high-protein ice cream which could be customized to be any flavor. The cooking blog, Eating Bird Food, explains how to make a peanut butter chocolate chip cottage cheese ice creamù without an ice cream maker. Another way to turn cottage cheese into a sweet treat is by blending it into a smoothie. This makes the smoothie creamier and gets rid of the texture of cottage cheese if that's been throwing you off from trying it. Similar to the ice cream, you can pick whichever flavor you want for your smoothie î for example, a recipe for a raspberry banana smoothie can be found on the same blog. For the already devoted appreciators of cottage cheese, here is a recipe that does not attempt to hide it but allows you to enjoy it in all its glory: a pineapple chia with cottage cheese breakfast bowl from Skinny Taste. Pineapple can be switched out for your fruit of preference and making this meal in a to-go container makes a perfect breakfast for a busy morning.† A more savory take on cottage cheese also presents itself in the breakfast category, but more subtly. Try Skinny Taste's scrambled eggs with cottage cheese, and you'll be feeling like Superman with the amount of protein you will be getting (over 17 grams per serving!).† To elevate cottage cheese to a more sophisticated level, cottage cheese can be incorporated into lasagna roll ups, another recipe provided by Skinny Taste, which presents an opportunity to enjoy cottage cheese for lunch or dinner. This recipe is vegetarian and takes less than an hour to prepare. These recipes show the versatility of cottage cheese and how easy it is to incorporate into everyday meals. However, it is important to consider the texture you want for each recipe. For the ice cream, it is recommended that a full-fat cottage cheese is used to ensure creaminess and prevent the ice cream from freezing solid. Some cottage cheese brands have more moist and tender consistencies, while others can be very thick, almost like Greek yogurt. The size of curds also varies from very small to large.† It may make you apprehensive to buy a full tub without knowing the texture and then ending up with something you don't enjoy. From the brands I have found in nearby grocery stores, here are the descriptions I would give each one: Good Culture is my absolute favorite. It is more on the thicker side with seemingly almost no moisture. They have varieties of fat content, small containers of plain cottage cheese and small containers of fruit-flavored cottage cheese. The curds are medium sized and vary in each batch. Even the low fat version is pretty creamy, and this is the brand I've seen used most frequently for the ice cream recipe.† My next shoutout goes to Daisy cottage cheese. This one is quite the opposite of Good Culture; it has a lot of moisture and every kernel is identically shaped. They also have versions of varying fat content, and I would recommend this one if you want to eat cottage cheese plain or in a bowl with toppings.† Knudsen's cottage cheese (which can actually be found in huge tubs at Costco) is an in-between. It has moisture, curds of different shapes and sizes and decent creaminess. It does have other ingredients apart from just cottage cheese, which I find give it a distinct flavor. Their small containers with fruit jam on the side make a great to-go snack!† So next time you're in the dairy aisle, don't pass by cottage cheese without considering the possibilities of how it could contribute to your recipes, snacks and nutrition.

on-the-menu,Food bank finds: potato medley home fries,29-Feb-24,10:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/food-bank-finds-potato-medley-home-fries/,"Turn your home fries into a complete meal by adding bacon, sausage, bell peppers or a fried egg. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus In my experience, there are two types of breakfast-eaters in this world: those who opt for savory flavors and those who opt for sweet. (No, I will not be acknowledging those who don't like breakfast. Your opinion is not valid here.) Personally, I fall into the former category î there's nothing better than waking up to a huge meal of eggs, sausage and melted cheese on toast. But if you are growing increasingly bored of the same old breakfast sandwich combination, I highly recommend introducing potatoes into your rotation.† Oh potatoes, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. Tater tots, hash browns, roasted potatoes¶ the list goes on and on. Yet the most underrated potato option in breakfast diners everywhere might just take the top spot in my heart: home fries. A heaping, warm mixture of potatoes, onions, garlic and savory seasonings is hearty, nostalgic and satisfying. Plus, they're an ideal vessel for extra toppings. Try adding bacon or sausage for a meaty flavor, or bell peppers for a pop of color and crunch. You can also top off your home fries with a scrambled egg and shredded cheese for a complete meal that will keep you full all morning long. But if you still aren't convinced, maybe this will help: all the ingredients you need for basic home fries are available free for† UC Santa Barbara students at the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank. As a college student who is chronically low on cash, no meal tastes better than a free meal.† Even while seasonal produce rotates through the A.S. Food Bank located in the back corner of the University Center's main floor, you can usually count on some variety of potatoes being in stock. Potatoes, a pantry staple renowned for their versatility and affordability, are traditionally harvested between late summer and mid-fall. However, thanks to modern-day technology and strategic crop rotation, potatoes in proper storage will stay in good condition for up to seven or eight months after harvesting. Thus, potatoes stay on grocery shelves all year long.† During the week of Feb. 19, the A.S. Food Bank offered russet potatoes, red potatoes, Garnet sweet potatoes and jewel sweet potatoes. In a pinch, you can turn any variety of potatoes into home fries. However, the starchier the potato is, the better it'll crisp up in the pan. Keep an eye out for russet potatoes, Yukon Gold potatoes and Garnet sweet potatoes for the best results. I chose to mix together three kinds of potatoes for color and variety, but feel free to opt for just one. Potato medley home fries† Duration: 25 minutes Yield: 2-3 servings Ingredients: Optional: Directions: If you're itching for more flavor, consider adding other seasonings like crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning or cumin. Whether you're a savory breakfast lover or just looking for a new way to enjoy potatoes, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your breakfast rotation. And with the availability of ingredients at the A.S. Food Bank, you can enjoy this delicious meal without breaking the bank.

on-the-menu,Loco for Zocalo: Isla Vista's most underrated dining destination,7-Mar-24,9:00 AM,['Josh Rhodes'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-07/loco-for-zocalo-isla-vistas-most-underrated-dining-destination/,"The quesabirria consists of two meat, cheese and onion tacos with a side on consome. It almost goes without saying in Isla Vista that Freebirds is perceived to be the uncontested king of Mexican food, and to challenge that notion often brings about a frenzy of crazed looks and a few that's a red flagù expressions aimed your way. However, I would like to bring to the forefront another Mexican eatery in I.V. that definitely makes a compelling challenge for the throne. Located toward the end of Pardall Road, just left of new restaurant Giovanni's Pizza, lies Zocalo, hidden gem of I.V. that has gone untasted and unreviewed for too long by On the Menu. My craving for Mexican food and my curiosity to try something new propelled me to give this restaurant a try. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.† As I pulled up to Zocalo on my bike just as night was beginning to set in, I got a positive first impression of the restaurant just by looking through the window at the vibrant, colorful lights illuminating in the store. Named after Mexico City's main central commercial square with entertainment, according to the restaurant's website, the founders î a UC Santa Barbara student's family î hoped that the eatery would be a place for team meetings, catching up with friends, grabbing a coffee, and some delicious food.ù The atmosphere in Zocalo strongly reflects the founders' desire for a communal atmosphere, with traditional multi-colored papel picado streamers decorating the right side of the store, the light-wood shelf on the left featuring small Latin-style dolls and a cute water container with a sombrero on top. Combined with the caf√© style layout, the entire establishment invokes an amalgamation of positive feelings from any guest who enters. Thinking back, maybe this fun atmosphere was why I ended up spending way more than I intended to on my meal. I felt deeply compelled to try everything featured on the large, overhead television screens just above the register. Thank goodness a small sense of rationality remained present in the far recesses of my brain as I fought the urge to splurge on more delicious-sounding menu items and add them to my already sizable order. I ordered the quesabirria, arroz con leche (rice with milk) and the espresso flan. The warm and strong meat and cheese smell emanating from my quesabirria takeout box was î to put it lightly î absolutely mouthwatering. The quesabirria consists of two perfectly crispy yet soft King Corn quesadillas that contain the pure meaty goodness of the birria (a stew of steak, cheese, onions and cilantro) and is served with a side of consomm√© (a clear, slightly spicy soup made from stock or broth) and a small assortment of vegetables. The consomm√© perfectly drew out the rich meat and cheese flavor from the dish and left me wanting more with each bite I took. I completely devoured the quesabirria within moments of having it placed in front of me, and so it should come as no surprise to any reader that I now consider myself a quesabirria fanatic and am therefore giving it a lofty 9/10 rating. Despite its $12.99 price point, which some might find steep, I believe the taste more than justifies the price. For dessert, flan was up next. My mom and I have made flan several times using homemade recipes. Thus, I consider myself to be a good judge. I was especially excited to try the espresso flan that Zocalo has on their menu. What caught my eye about this flan specifically was the advertised espresso flavoring, which I had never heard of before. But I was a bit underwhelmed when I could only taste the espresso baked into the flan in a few bites, especially since it cost $4.95. While the flan still had the silky, smooth and semi-gelatinous texture that I know and love, the flavor aspect was lacking. Don't get me wrong, I still loved the flan and would give it a high rating of 7.5/10; I'm super appreciative that there is a restaurant in I.V. that sells a slice of home to me, but I just think it doesn't really live up to its advertised rich espresso flavor. I still gobbled up the dessert like a madman and highly implore those who want to try it to do so as the flan part won't disappoint. Despite already ordering a dessert, I just had to try the arroz con leche that was cleverly placed right at the checkout. At $3.99, what's one more dessert, am I right? Despite having no knowledge of what a typical arroz con leche dessert is supposed to look like, I was still shocked that the dessert looked like the goopy oatmeal that I sometimes have for breakfast. However, the smell emanating from the dessert was another story entirely. The rich cinnamon combined with the minute yet light, refreshing milk wafting from the dessert immediately made my mouth start to water in anticipation. Taking my first few bites, it was hard to ignore the semi-random chunks of rice floating around in the otherwise more liquid dessert and, despite enjoying the taste to some degree î most likely because I was already stuffed from my previous food indulgences î I decided to call it a night, having only eaten about one-third of the delight. At this point, I was planning to rate it around a 6/10. However, after taking it home, I was surprised to discover that letting the dessert sit in the refrigerator overnight boosted the flavor and texture of all ingredients, especially the rice as it softened up significantly in the mixture over time, making the dessert all the more enjoyable. Maybe it's just a late bloomer? After a night in the depths of my stuffed refrigerator, I would give the dessert a 7/10 rating and definitely recommend trying the dessert.† Early the next morning, I ended up at Zocalo again to try their Mazap√°n (a Mexican almond candy) latte that piqued my interest on the menu board just outside the main entrance. The latte was decent and had a slight nutty flavor which I enjoyed. However, the drink was too sweet and creamy for my taste, so it's a respectable 6/10 in my book. The Mazapan latte is creamy with a sweet, nutty flavor. All in all, I highly recommend Zocalo. By offering a diverse menu of Mexican food in all courses, it's quickly becoming my new favorite restaurant in I.V. I absolutely will be returning to try more of their menu and to meet up with friends for a delicious dinner, dessert or coffee.

on-the-menu,Paul Hollywood's Pies & Pudsù: Indulge in pastry perfection,15-Mar-24,8:07 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-15/115235/,"The French-style apple tart's crust was nothing short of golden, buttery goodness. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus I watch The Great British Bake Offù the way some people watch The Bachelorù: religiously. If you're like me, then you're familiar with the beloved (and feared) judge, Paul Hollywood. While primarily known as the King of Breadù, Hollywood has written dozens of recipe books on more than just yeast creations. Though published in 2014, Paul Hollywood's Pies & Pudsù is a timeless cookbook that includes hundreds of mouthwatering meals and desserts enveloped in pastry dough. In honor of upcoming Pi Day î the one day a year that bakers and mathematicians find something in common î Hollywood's cookbook seemed like a natural choice for review. My mother had already given glowing recommendations for two other cookbooks of Hollywood's, so I opened Pies & Pudsù with high expectations. It did not disappoint. The cookbook is well-organized and very aesthetically pleasing, with tantalizing photos accompanying nearly every recipe î a huge draw in my opinion. Another positive was the diverse selection of recipes: Puds & Piesù includes both savory and sweet options of traditional pies and puddings, plus tarts, hand pies, empanadas, pastries and more.† Prospective readers should note that this cookbook was written by a Briton, and thus all measurements adhere to the metric system. I own a kitchen scale, so this was not a hurdle for me. However, in a pinch, you can easily consult the internet for grams-to-cups conversions. Although, Pies & Pudsù might just be the excuse you need to buy a kitchen scale: they are affordable (generally less than $15), increase accuracy and ensure consistency, guaranteeing your baked goods turn out perfect every time.† Admittedly, I experienced culture shock just while reading some of the recipe names and ingredients. Pies & Pudsù includes niche dishes that I've never heard of before, like Bedfordshire clanger, Wensleydale pie and Cumberland rum nicky. Presumably, these and others are common dishes in northern England, where Hollywood grew up. Though their names are daunting, Hollywood outlines their recipes with short ingredient lists and easy instructions. In the foreword, he articulates his affection for straightforward baking, which generations of English laborers, farmers and fishermen have thrived on.† The ingredients themselves were another curiosity. Hollywood's recipes frequently incorporate rum, ale, rabbit, buffalo, obscure white fish and dates î all ingredients I've never cooked with before. Though intimidating, I welcomed the opportunity to expand my baking comfort zone. In order to holistically review the cookbook's fare without spending all of my weekly earnings on butter and flour, I picked one savory and one sweet recipe to test. The first was the French-style apple tart, made from a sweetened shortcrust pastry and loaded with frangipane and slivered apples. For anyone unfamiliar with frangipane, it's an almond paste that becomes set and fluffy when cooked. It was subtly sweet, and the nuttiness well complimented the bright tang of the apple layer. The crust, of course, was nothing short of golden, buttery goodness. Hollywood's secret ingredients, lemon juice and lard, bring a tenderness to the dough that butter alone cannot accomplish. The tart came together rather quickly î about an hour, start to finish î and did not necessitate any complicated techniques or cooking equipment. It would be the perfect dish for any springtime party. The spinach, feta & pine nut parcels were akin to empanadas, though the filling was encased in a soft bread dough, rather than traditional shortcrust. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus The second recipe I chose was the spinach, feta and pine nut parcels. These triangular-shaped pastries were akin to empanadas, though the filling was encased in a soft bread dough, rather than traditional shortcrust. The result was a pillowy, warm hand pie, sectioned into individual servings. While the crust was delicious, the inside stuffing was the true triumph: a combination of warm spinach, crispy garlic, roasted pine nuts and salty feta cheese. Hollywood's recipe skillfully blends different savory flavors and textures to create a complex flavor profile out of rather simple ingredients. This recipe took slightly longer on account of waiting for the dough to rise î about two hours, start to finish î but the result was worthwhile. These pastry parcels travel well and taste wonderful hot or cold, making them ideal for picnics or dinner parties. Next on my radar is the cheese, potato and onion pie. After that, maybe I'll find the courage to tackle the Bedfordshire clanger. With hundreds of intriguing options, Paul Hollywood's Pies & Pudsù is perfect not only for Pi Day, but every other day of the year. I highly recommend you give this cookbook a try.

on-the-menu,Letter from the Editor: lessons in food writing and growth,21-Mar-24,9:00 AM,['Stephanie Gerson'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-21/letter-from-the-editor-lessons-in-food-writing-and-growth/,"Maddy Fangio / Daily Nexus This week marks my final one spent as an editor of On the Menu. I'm graduating a quarter early, which means leaving my second home, the Nexus newsroom, three months before what I originally planned.† I'm not sure how I feel: a mix of sadness from leaving behind my Nexus family, relief from, hopefully, never spending numerous hours meticulously designing a print spread again, but definitely a sense of pride towards the many things my colleagues and I accomplished here.† Every once in a while, I'll stalk my own author's page on the Daily Nexus website, re-reading my own work and critiquing it as most writers do. I tend to always gravitate toward my very first article: the one of which I am the least proud. I have the option to delete it with access to the backend of our website and all of its contents. Yet, I choose not to. You, reader, can still read it and cringe to this day. For those who haven't read this article published in 2020, my words detail a full day of vegan meals I cooked as a college freshman living in Isla Vista and taking online classes during the pandemic.† The article itself feels like a time capsule, a snapshot of one of the darkest periods of modern history. It is my first piece of food writing, one that came about by talking to a peer during a socially distanced coffee outing. She informed me about a side gig she enjoyed: writing and photographing for On the Menu. As a major foodie and lover of home-cooked meals, I didn't even need her to go into further detail about On the Menu before I was already begging to write my first article. So, no, I'm not entirely embarrassed by my early writing for this section. I see those articles î the several recipes about which I wrote to cope with the messiness of the world î as the naive beginning of my food writing career which unexpectedly blossomed during my college years, during a conversation over cups of coffee, 6 feet apart, masked and sitting outside on the Caj√© patio.† I constrained myself to write recipes for the first year and a half of my writing journey. It felt safe and inside of my comfort zone as, for years prior, I had been sharing my own recipes with family and friends. Yet, once I started to engage in conversation about food with people in somewhat invisible roles in the eyes of the consumer ì pastry chefs, restaurant owners, food entrepreneurs ì I truly found my calling. My passion for talking to others about food even led me to write about food for publications back home in the Bay Area for two consecutive summers. Despite thinking I was more of an introvert all these years, I realized I did like talking to people and discovered cooking to be a subject over which even two people who couldn't be more alike (in my case, I, a college student scrapping together meals in my tiny apartment's kitchen and, in the cases of my interviewees, someone who risked it all to share their culinary creations with the public) could bond.† When I couldn't find the support I needed from myself to pull together these ambitious features before our Sunday night article deadline, I found it from my fellow Nexites who painstakingly read, edited and fact-checked my work with a level of detail and compassion that I didn't expect from our tiny newsroom. I have to thank my On the Menu co-editors past and present, Abigail Monti, Chace Duma and Michelle Lee, for hearing my numerous article pitches and always believing in me to somehow pull them together in time. I also want to thank the Copy team for instilling in me the absence of the Oxford comma and Editor-in-Chiefs Pricila Flores and Atmika Iyer for passing along food news tips and guiding me throughout my time here.† The friends I've made at the Nexus have shaped my college experience, making me and my once-thought-to-be meaningless words feel like a valued contribution to something larger, to a brilliant and talented community-led effort. It's been a pleasure to lead On the Menu throughout its evolution and, looking back, I wouldn't change a single thing, not even my very first article.†

on-the-menu,Spring into spring quarter with KOZY's new spring drinks,21-Mar-24,10:00 AM,['Kendra Martinez'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-21/spring-into-spring-quarter-with-kozys-new-spring-drinks/,"After the success of its specialty winter menu, KOZY Coffee has recently transitioned into a new spring menu that is full of refreshing drinks perfect for the new season. The spring menu is quite diverse in drinks and offers something for everyone. Still, being the coffee enthusiast who reviewed their winter holiday drinks, this menu has broadened my horizons at KOZY and I was pleasantly surprised. Here are my honest reviews: Honey lavender latte 10/10 One bad experience with lavender is enough to deter you away from the flavor forever. I had a bad lavender coffee experience a couple of months ago and haven't ordered anything lavender-flavored since î until now. I was reluctant to go try the honey lavender latte, but it's safe to say that my faith in lavender coffee has been restored and I will be ordering it more often. The subtle notes of lavender mixed with honey make for a refreshing latte that's neither too sweet nor overpowering. The lavender merely enhances an already delicious KOZY staple î it is definitely my favorite off of the new menu.† Strawberry matcha 9/10 This strawberry matcha drink tastes natural, perfectly sweet, and guaranteed to turn any matcha skeptic into a fanatic. Kendra Martinez / Daily Nexus Any matcha drink that is able to turn a firm believer that all matcha tastes like grass into a matcha fiend deserves recognition. The strawberry matcha latte did just that. The makers of the drink definitely made the right call in using strawberry puree for the flavoring instead of traditional strawberry syrup. The naturalness of the puree gives the drink enough flavor without it being too sweet. The matcha had an interesting yet enjoyable aftertaste that keeps you wanting more and, quite frankly, I don't know if any other matcha drink can compare. It was a close second on my list.† Strawberry lavender lemonade 7/10 Refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day, and certainly packs a punch, what more can be said about this strawberry lavender lemonade?†Kendra Martinez / Daily Nexus A nice alternative to the caffeinated drinks, the strawberry lavender lemonade was very flavorful and I can totally see it being the go-to drink on the warmer spring days. The strawberry and lavender gave the lemonade a refreshing taste, but a word of caution to those who may not be used to strong flavors: this combination can be a little overpowering. The drink would be slightly better if the syrup measurements were dialed back a little bit. Salted caramel cold brew 7/10 White it is quite delicious with a perfectly sweet cold foam, the salted caramel cold brew falls short in the salted caramel flavor department. Kendra Martinez / Daily Nexus After trying the Nutcracker cold brew from their winter menu, the salted caramel cold brew pales in comparison. The full effect of the flavor did not kick in until all of the cold foam was mixed into the cold brew. Once it did, the caramel was really subtle. Because I'm not the biggest caramel fan, the drink was quite delicious and the cold foam was perfectly sweet. However, given the name, I was expecting more of the salted caramel notes to come through.† All in all, the KOZY spring menu is a hit. The two drinks everyone should try are definitely the honey lavender latte and the strawberry matcha. They would be the perfect pick-me-ups after finals this week or the right way to kick off spring quarter after break.

on-the-menu,Protein-packed snacks,1-Apr-24,9:46 AM,['Nina Timofeyeva'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-01/protein-packed-snacks/," In the fast-paced whirlwind of school days, finding the right snacks to fuel our bodies can be a challenge. Whether you're a student burning the midnight oil or an athlete looking to optimize performance, one thing remains constant: the need for quality nutrition. And at the heart of any nutritious diet lies the powerhouse macronutrient î protein. Protein isn't just for bodybuilders and gym buffs; according to Kris Gunnars from the popular health information source Healthline Media, protein is an essential component for everyone, aiding in muscle repair, boosting metabolism and keeping hunger at bay. But with the plethora of snack options available, how do you ensure you're getting enough protein without sacrificing taste or convenience? Doctors recommend that the average person leading a sedentary lifestyle should consume around 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, and this amount increases to 1-1.2 grams for those who exercise regularly. This would mean an active individual weighing 150 pounds, or 68 kilograms, would need to consume 68-82 grams of protein per day. If this is averaged over the course of three meals and three snacks, each intake would have to contain an average of 11-14 grams of protein. This may not seem like a huge number, but looking at common snack foods like fruits, cookies, chips and various drinks, one will find that it can be quite challenging to find options that will satisfy the recommended protein amount. I have searched for and personally tried a variety of protein-rich snacks ranging from savory to sweet, crunchy to creamy, and I can say there's a high-protein snack to suit every palate and preference. Personally, I usually fall into the sweet snacks camp, but there are a couple of savory snack options that I still consistently enjoy and will be sure to include them in this review. One of these is actually my most common choice: the Pacific Gold beef jerky. The greatest aspect of this snack is that it's sold at Costco in individual packs that are easy to take anywhere, require absolutely no preparation and contain 15 grams of protein. I've also been recently introduced to the turkey jerky made by Costco's original brand, Kirkland Signature, and was not disappointed. Their recipe is a bit on the sweeter side but has a subtle flavor. I found that this jerky could even be incorporated into meals such as rice dishes, on top of salad and in omelets. This option contains a bit less protein but still quite fulfilling at 10 grams per ounce. Another easy to-go savory option is hard boiled eggs. Many of us have heard of the egg ick,ù but I think that this issue can commonly be fixed with the correct preparation of the eggs. First, consider what texture you want your eggs to be. I prefer mine to be similar to the ones you often find on top of ramen. With a solid egg white and a soft, somewhat runny yolk, these small bites can even be called beautiful. I like to top mine with salt and Trader Joe's Pizza Sprinkle Seasoning Blend for a flavorful combination. Another option is to marinade your eggs, as is commonly done in Asian cuisine, with a dish called mayak gyeran. The eggs are marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, garlic, gochugaru and other additional ingredients to make an irresistible addition to your meals or on their own. A serving of two eggs will provide you with 12 grams of complete protein, as well as healthy fats.† Of course the savory snack list would be incomplete without cheese. Mozzarella, asiago, parmesan, cheddar and many more varieties can now be found at most grocery stores in small, individually packaged portions. And you don't necessarily have to feel like you're in kindergarten by getting cheese sticks î you can opt for the more sophisticated snacking cheesesù by BelGioioso. I like to combine them with nuts and grapes to recreate the (often overpriced but so enticing) protein boxesù you find near checkout displays in cafes and grocery stores. Grabbing two of these snacking cheeses can provide up to 15 grams of protein. Switching over to the sweeter snacks, I'll start with the snack that most commonly pops into people's heads when they hear high protein:ù protein bars. I have searched far and wide to find a protein bar that doesn't get stuck in my throat, make my stomach ache or just taste like cardboard, and I am proud to say that I have been successful. In fact, I have found bars that are not just tolerable, but ones that I am inclined to treat as dessert and am just a bit obsessed with. The first is Barebells, which come in a variety of flavors such as cookies and cream, chocolate dough, creamy crisp, salted peanut caramel and many more. These bars have a soft texture that cannot be beaten by any brand (that I know of so far), and most people compare them to candy bars. They typically consist of a protein layer, topped with caramel or chocolate fudge and coated in a chocolate shell with pieces of nuts or crispy puffs and contain 20 grams of protein. They also have both whey and plant protein-based options. They can be a bit pricey compared to other bars on the market, but I would highly recommend at least giving them a try if you're looking for your new favorite protein bar.† My next favorite is the Perfect Bar. These bars are fully vegan, contain anywhere from 9-17 grams of protein and also have the additional nutritional value of healthy fats. These bars use nut butters as their base and add over 20 superfoods, packing in an extremely dense nutrient profile into such a small volume. They come in flavors such as dark chocolate chip peanut butter, salted caramel, dark chocolate almond, chocolate hazelnut crisp and more. Once again, these bars can be a bit pricey, but I have often been able to find them at Costco, which turns out to be much more wallet friendly.  If you prefer the convenience of snacks that do not require chewing î you know, for those Zoom meetings with a microphone picking up every noise î I would recommend Fairlife. This brand offers lots of options of ultra-filtered, lactose-free milk, which is a great complete protein source. You can buy their milk as you normally would at the grocery store. You can also try their Core Power line, which makes vanilla, chocolate and strawberry banana flavored protein drinks containing 26 grams of protein in the original version or 42 grams of protein in the Elite version. And, of course, I have to shout out Costco once again for carrying their chocolate Fairlife Nutrition Plan drinks, which contain 30 grams of protein per serving.  The final high-protein snack I would like to suggest will always have my heart, at any time of day and in nearly any form: yogurt. Most people have heard of the benefits of Greek yogurt, but I encourage you to look a little deeper in the dairy aisle to find Icelandic-style yogurt, also called Skyr, which can contain up to 20 grams of protein in less than a cup. I personally enjoy the brands siggi's and Icelandic Provisions. This creamy and tart snack can be mixed with a multitude of different toppings, ranging from berries to peanut butter to chocolate to nuts and many, many more. While trying out millions of combinations, I've started to think that if it can be an ice cream flavor, it can probably be mixed into yogurt. Yogurt is extremely versatile and comes in different flavors, textures and levels of tartness, making it quite likely that any dairy lover will be able to find one that they enjoy.†  With these options, I hope to bring to you a world in which hitting your protein goals doesn't involve choking down dry protein bars or downing powder-based protein shakes. And even if you're not actively thinking about how much protein you consume, I would still recommend giving these snacks a try just because they're delicious, and you might just get a little extra benefit from them as well.

on-the-menu,Free tacos from local vendors attract hundreds at Deltopia,11-Apr-24,10:00 AM,['Nina Timofeyeva'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-11/free-tacos-attract-hundreds-at-deltopia/,"Festival goers waited hours to receive their free meals. Nina Timofeyeva / Daily Nexus Hundreds of hungry students descended upon the tents serving tacos at the Isla Vista Spring Festival, and one could practically feel the hunger radiating from these jaded party-goers. Four brave local restaurants dished out meals for the seemingly never-ending crowds of Deltopia attendants from 1-6 p.m. For five hours, students enjoyed and judged the tacos for the first-ever Best of I.V. Taco Contest.ù The contestants included Zocalo, Roger's Tacos, Maria's Tacos and Elubia's Kitchen.† The Best of I.V. Taco Contestù took place during the Isla Vista Spring Festival, which was hosted by the Isla Vista Community Services District in collaboration with partners such as Farmacy Isla Vista. Apart from the tacos being served, the event included live music, arts and crafts, snack and water stations, face painting, henna and more. The tacos, however, held the spotlight. Due to the massive amounts of people, some stood in lines for over an hour to receive their meals. This difficulty of accessibility dampened the contestù aspect of the event, as visitors would be lucky to eventually receive one meal from any of the four businesses. In the end, it could be said that all businesses won in terms of getting their names out and giving Isla Vista residents an opportunity to try their food in hopes of gaining returning customers.† Chicken, carne asada, vegetables and rice and beans tacos were available for free. Nina Timofeyeva / Daily Nexus Among the four tents, the taco varieties being served included chicken, carne asada, vegetables and rice and beans. Different types of salsa, guacamole and toppings differed among the businesses as well, with each restaurant offering their own personal take on this classic dish.† I was able to get my hands on the chicken tacos from Maria's Tacos. While the meal was free and certainly satisfying after hours of walking around Deltopia, I can't say that these tacos were particularly delicious. Perhaps it was because the cooks were more focused on the speed of food delivery rather than the details of preparation. The tortillas were a bit raw, the chicken wasn't particularly seasoned and the presentation was quite messy overall. I was also left desperately wishing that avocado was present in the meal since the overall dish was a tad dry in texture, even despite the salsa. The flavors that were present were good though, with the salsa being quite spicy and the onions adding a punch as well. Generally, the ingredients were fresh and came together nicely to form a colorful and balanced dish, which I'm certain satisfied many customers on this day. Trying these tacos does leave me curious about whether Maria's Tacos can provide an even better dish under less pressured conditions on the home turf of their restaurant.† For five hours, the local restaurants dished out meals for hungry Deltopia participants. Nina Timofeyeva / Daily Nexus I would like to thank the four businesses and take a moment to appreciate their efforts to provide so much food under high-stress conditions. The workers of these small businesses undertook a tremendous effort to carry out this operation, and even if some businesses didn't serve their most grandiose meals this weekend, they should be given the chance of impressing customers at their restaurants. So head on out to your local restaurant serving tacos and support the small businesses keeping Isla Vista fed and satisfied.  A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the April 11, 2024, print edition of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Colorful and carefree: a recipe for chuski and a smile,18-Apr-24,10:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/colorful-and-carefree-a-recipe-for-chuski-and-a-smile/,"Michelle Wu / Daily Nexus There's some harbinger of change that catches a lift in the spring breeze every year, jostling the curtains, swirling eddies of dust in the basking glow of the sun, through the rose bushes of my neighborhood and into my room. I get an urge to cut my hair as short as possible, feel the sun on the back of my neck, trade in my sneakers for flip flops and sandals, fervent academia to restless dreaming. But, every year, when this wind of change comes around, there is something I hold onto î a constant in my life, the pinnacle of every summer of my life thus far: chuski (or gola, depending on what part of India you're from), something akin to shaved ice. Gola reminds me of the summers of my youth, one hand in my nana's, the other sticky with sweet syrup and sweat. This is no ordinary shaved ice in my eyes. The flavors we get from common shaved ice vendors such as Kona Ice are dull in flavor, one indistinguishable from the next, often even leaving a sour taste in my mouth. I last went to India six summers ago, but the flavors of the cola and rose syrups on my tongue are just as colorful, comforting and equally invigorating as ever. I wonder, is my chuski is actually better than what I've had in America, or is it the feeling, the memories I made while eating it that make it sweeter and more satisfying? There's only one way to tell: have someone else try it for me! Here, I have a recipe for how you can make chuski on your own. While you can use any syrup of your choice, I recommend the three included in the recipe below for the most authentic flavor. Chuski/gola: Yield: 1 serving
Duration: 10 minutes Ingredients: Crushed ice (as much as you'd like)
Pinch of black salt
One, or many, of the following syrups: rose, Kala Khatta, Rooh Afza (found in an Indian store or online)
Popsicle stick Instructions: Crush as much ice as you desire for your gola (you can do this by wrapping your ice in a rag and beating it with a rolling pin or other hard object).
Take the ice and shape it into a round shape, as spherical as possible.
Stick the popsicle stick in the round shaped ice, molding it closer to the stick so that it is firmly attached.
Take the syrups of your choosing, pour into a bowl and rotate the ice so as to coat it completely (alternatively, you can pour the syrup onto the ice to achieve more discrete flavor portions).

on-the-menu,Lao Wang's nifty noodle bowl is sure to knock your socks off,18-Apr-24,10:00 AM,['Josh Rhodes'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/lao-wangs-nifty-noodle-bowl-is-sure-to-knock-your-socks-off/,"The eccentric seating in Lao Wang includes a punching bag within a round table. Josh Rhodes / Daily Nexus As the site of numerous club fundraisers and Greek life events, Lao Wang has cemented itself as one of the most social and vibrant restaurants in Isla Vista. The quaint noodles, buns and brew spot just across the street from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity house is a top dining destination in Isla Vista that can satisfy nearly all hunger cravings. Feeling ravenous after watching the first half of the NCAA men's tournament final between the University of Connecticut Huskies and the Purdue University Boilermakers, I decided to pay a visit to the Asian eatery with a signature vibrant, sometimes stadium-like, atmosphere.† Lao Wang has a unique aesthetic compared to most restaurants in Isla Vista. Boasting an interesting ensemble of paint colors î ranging from lime green, brown and white î and decorations î including a boxing bag in the center of the dining area î the restaurant's joy is infectious, spreading naturally even before the first bite. Lao Wang has three main menu items: rice bowls, bao buns and noodle bowls. Going off the recommendation of the cashier, I decided to order a Lao Wang Mala Tang Noodleù bowl. The bowl is a create-your-own style meal, offering customers the ability to customize their order through different broths, noodles and toppings. Customers can pick three toppings total, ranging from your standard meats to quail egg and enoki mushroom. Already included toppings are napa cabbage, green onion, cilantro, garlic and peanuts. My egg noodle bowl with chicken, enoki mushroom and quail eggs in the classic broth cost $16.48, taxes included. The customizable egg noodle bowl above features chicken, enoki mushrooms, and quail eggs. Josh Rhodes / Daily Nexus Initially, I was very put off by the price of the noodle bowl as it's over $4 more than Lao Wang's rice bowl and definitely more expensive than most main course meals from other I.V. restaurants. As I waited for my order, I found myself asking, Can this noodle bowl really justify such a high price?ù I'm happy to report that despite breaking the bank a bit, I was overjoyed with my noodle bowl and definitely got my money's worth in terms of quality.† Immediately, the main standout was the broth. The broth was warm and creamy and tied all the other ingredients in the bowl together. I added some vinegar, chili oil, soy sauce and a peanut sauce to the broth per the recommendation of a regular customer, and this made the broth even better.† The egg noodles were also amazing and complimented all the other ingredients. Smaller and skinnier than similar ramen noodles, I really enjoyed how Lao Wang's noodles didn't take up a lot of space in the bowl, making room for all the other toppings I chose. The pairing of peanuts and napa cabbage was surprisingly enjoyable.† If I had to be honest, the chicken left a lot to be desired in terms of taste î it was dry and lacked substance in my opinion. However, the broth more than compensated for the chicken's lack of flavor. Overall, the bowl and the broth taste were comparable to a quality Japanese ramen dish.† I would give the Lao Wang Mala Tang Noodleù bowl a 7.5 out of 10 stars. While I really enjoyed my meal, I definitely still experienced some buyer's remorse with how much the bowl cost. All in all, Lao Wang is a restaurant that embraces I.V.'s social culture with style. The fun, vibrant atmosphere of the eatery is the perfect place for a dinner with friends and family, and is certainly worth a visit.

on-the-menu,Farm fresh finds: a guide to local spring produce,25-Apr-24,8:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-25/farm-fresh-finds-a-guide-to-local-spring-produce/,"Seasonal produce of various colors can be found at your local market. As we leave winter quarter behind and head into spring î marked in Isla Vista by intermittent sunshine, rain and relentlessly annoying coastal fog î local markets begin bursting with colorful spring produce. UC Santa Barbara's location on California's Central Coast offers a prime locale for purchasing fresh, locally sourced produce. Watch out for the following fruits and vegetables returning to shelves after months of unavailability. Strawberries, perhaps, are the most eagerly awaited local crop. Grown throughout the Central Coast and the San Joaquin Valley, this juicy fruit peaks during the spring months. Throughout the cooler months, growers in Santa Maria and Oxnard continue to harvest this quintessential spring fruit, allowing strawberries to remain on grocery shelves throughout the fall. While imported berries are generally sold year-round by chain grocery stores, consider supporting local vendors for freshly picked, locally grown strawberries, which are often brighter and sweeter than store-bought varieties. Some local farms are even open to the public for berry picking during the spring: Lane Farms Strawberry Patch, located at 308 S. Walnut Lane, Santa Barbara, is open on Sundays from March until June. Grab a gallon bucket and your friends and stop by! Consider adding your bounty to green salads, yogurt parfaits and homemade smoothies. But strawberries aren't the only bite-sized fruit heralded by spring: blueberry and cherry season is nearly underway. Both blueberries and cherries thrive in California's temperate spring climate and can be readily found in stores from April to midsummer. Enjoy both by the handful, tossed into salads or baked into pies and muffins. Avocados are another seasonal favorite. Peaking in spring and lasting through the summer, California-grown avocados can be easily found in local grocery stores and farmers markets. While consumers can buy imported avocados year-round, locally grown fruits have the advantage of being picked and arriving in your home in just a few days î that kind of freshness is hard to beat. Take advantage of California's avocado season by adding them to Thai-style spring rolls, spreading them on breakfast toasts and mashing them into homemade guacamole. Perhaps the most underrated spring arrival is asparagus. Known for its slim stalks and earthy, slightly bitter flavor, asparagus thrives near the Central Coast and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Packed with vitamins A, C, E, K, iron, potassium and calcium, this versatile vegetable is a rich source of antioxidants. Prepare them over the stovetop, under the broiler or even on the grill. From roasted asparagus to fresh spring asparagus salads to creamy asparagus soup, there are countless ways to enjoy this springtime specialty. In addition to these seasonal favorites, California's spring harvest includes a variety of leafy greens: watch out for spinach, kale and Swiss chard. Packed with vitamins and minerals, these nutrient-rich greens are the perfect addition to springtime salads, stir fries and smoothies. Want to shop local and don't know where to start? The Santa Barbara Certified Farmers Market has six locations î Goleta, Santa Barbara Old Town, Downtown Santa Barbara, Solvang, Montecito and Carpinteria îthat host markets on different days throughout the week. On Tuesdays, try the Santa Barbara Old Town location, located on the 500 and 600 blocks of State Street from 3-7 p.m. On Saturdays, the Downtown Santa Barbara location hosts on 119 East Cota Street from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. And on Sundays, visit the Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.† With dozens of local vendors at its six locations, the Santa Barbara Certified Farmers Market is sure to satisfy your produce needs. While farmers markets tend to be more costly than big-box grocery stores, the difference in quality is tastable. Plus, those enrolled in CalFresh benefits can take advantage of the Market Match program, which incentivizes participants to shop locally. For example, a customer who spends $10 of CalFresh benefits at the farmers market receives an additional $10 to spend on fresh produce, for a total of $20 to spend at the market. As we gladly embrace the change of seasons, make the most of California's spring produce. Whether you frequent farmers markets, neighborhood grocery stores or roadside stands, you're sure to find an array of irresistible fruits and vegetables.† A version of this article appeared on p.8 of the April 25, 2024 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,UCSB's Ra√≠ces de mi Tierra hosts second annual Sabores de mi Tierra night market,25-Apr-24,8:00 AM,['Kendra Martinez'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-25/ucsbs-raices-de-mi-tierra-hosts-second-annual-sabores-de-mi-tierra-night-market/,"Hermanas Unidas de UCSB sold both sweet and savory empanadas. All food items were handmade by student club members. UC Santa Barbara's Ra√≠ces de mi Tierra held its second annual Sabores de mi Tierra night market at Little Acorn Park on April 20.† Intended to bring some of the flavors from Mexico to the Isla Vista community, the market was made up of several on-campus Latine clubs and organizations. Sabores de mi Tierra translates to flavors from my land,ù so each organization was in charge of bringing a dish to sell at the fundraiser. Present at the fundraiser was UCSB's Ra√≠ces de mi Tierra, Hermanas Unidas, Lambda Sigma Gamma, Sigma Lambda Gamma, Comunidad Latinx Graduaci√≥n and Latinos 4 Politics. After seeing the event flyer on Instagram, I decided to give Sabores de mi Tierra a try.† This was the second year Ra√≠ces de mi Tierra hosted the event, and they plan on continuing to have the night market each year. Event organizers and club members third-year aquatic biology major Sarah Rodriguez and third-year sociology major Roselin Villa hope to turn the market into a yearly staple for the community. They were responsible for reaching out to all the clubs and organizations involved and asking them to participate in making food to sell. All the food served was entirely student-made. The profits from the event are used to cover the cost of renting the park, and the rest is kept by the clubs and organizations to cover their needs. This year, the food sold at the market included strawberries with cream, dessert and meat empanadas, aguas frescas, corn esquites, shaved ice and fruit.† The fun and welcoming energy of Hermanas Unidas drew me into their booth, where I tried the homemade dessert and meat empanadas. The sweet empanada was filled with strawberry jam and chunks of strawberry. It was deliciously sweet and the empanada itself had an almost puff pastry texture that was flakey and not too dense. As for the meat empanada, it was full of flavor and reminded me of Porto's Bakery's potato balls, since the filling was a combination of ground beef and onions, along with plenty of seasoning. The ratio of pastry to filling was quite good and combined nicely in the mouth. Overall, the empanadas were a delicious treat, and I would enjoy seeing them return next year.† The meat empanadas were filled with ground beef, onions and seasonings. After eating my empanadas, I made my way over to Ra√≠ces de mi Tierra's stand to purchase a drink. They sold three flavors of agua frescas: jamaica, watermelon and cucumber lime. They also had the option to add a Taj√≠n and chamoy rim to the cup to make the drink more flavorful. I tried the jamaica with the rim, and it was the perfect drink to wash down my empanadas. It was refreshing and subtly sweet, which really let the hibiscus notes come through and had a nice taste of home. The added element of Taj√≠n and chamoy î although a little messy around the cup î made for an interesting combination of flavors that I was a fan of.† The jamaica, watermelon and cucumber lime aqua frescas came with the option of a Taj√≠n and chamoy rim. Another refreshing treat offered was the fruit stand by Latinos 4 Politics. They had a variety of cut fruit available with the option of adding Taj√≠n and chamoy, which was mouth-wateringly delicious. Combining fruit with Taj√≠n and chamoy is a staple in many Mexican households, and I loved to see the tradition being shared with the I.V. community. Overall, the fruit cup was a tasty treat that had a nice kick to it.† While I was not able to try the other food at the market, several students were lining up around the stands. The ambiance of the event was lively, and students were all conversing with each other as they got their food. There was a strong sense of camaraderie at Little Acorn Park. Sabores de mi Tierra was a fun and delicious event with great energy, and I can't wait to go again next year.

on-the-menu,"Nimbu pani, for a simply refreshing time",2-May-24,8:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-02/nimbu-pani-for-a-simply-refreshing-time/," Something deep within my memory was unlocked after months of dormancy as I sipped on nimbu pani (which translates to lime waterù and is the Indian version of limeade) at the Apna Indian Kitchen restaurant in downtown Santa Barbara. With each taste, I strolled deeper and deeper into the memories of my childhood and awoke a craving that I hadn't been privy to in some time.† As a child, every trip to India involved the transport of many highly desired American products to India for our enormous extended family, suitcases packed with more iPhones and handbags than any of our personal belongings. And in our return to the states, we were always heavily rewarded. Heavily rewarded not just with the best silver and gold jewelry but especially with the local sweets, snacks and spices that couldn't be found easily here in America. Among the spices that we often brought back was, in my opinion, the culinary claim to fame of my people, specifically of those practicing the Jain religion: the famous Jain shikanji masala. This masala is a magic cure-all for any weak-tasting dish, and in my household, we used it on everything from fruits to curries and especially in our drinks. The masala is the spice that, when mixed with the right ingredients, is meant to produce a most revitalizing drink that hails from northern India. The drink possesses citrusy notes brought out in a wonderfully refreshing melange of Indian spices and a light kiss of mint flavor from the garnishing leaves.† Now, I know that unfortunately many of you will not be able to easily get your hands on this Jain shikanji masala, so below I have attached for you a simpler recipe for nimbu pani, which I once thought was highly different from shikanji but is actually quite similar save for the fact that it doesn't use the shikanji masala but rather a more simple chaat masala that you can find at any local international market.† Nimbu pani: Yield: 2 servings Duration: 10 minutes Ingredients: Instructions: Again, once you make this recipe, you will get a taste for what parts of it you enjoy and what you don't. Feel free to make modifications and turn it into your own version of limeade. Often I have seen people remove sugar from the dish all together to really bring out the more acidic flavors of the drink, which is certainly not for the faint of heart but provides an equally refreshing taste. I have also seen Apna Indian Kitchen use gingerade as part of the drink, which I loved (but my friends, not so much). Whatever you do, remember to drink it as fast as possible since it is most enjoyable at a chilled temperature.† A version of this article appeared on p. 8 of the May 2, 2024 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Student-run eatery Friday's stakes compelling claim on I.V. sandwich scene,2-May-24,8:00 AM,['Josh Rhodes'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-02/student-run-eatery-fridays-stakes-compelling-claim-on-i-v-sandwich-scene/,"Unbeknownst to most Isla Vista residents, a new must-see food shop has opened up its doors and is taking the sandwich scene by storm. Friday's is a two-man, student organized pop-up restaurant operated out of an almost-hidden residential apartment just to the right of Little Acorn Park on Sabado Tarde Road. Every Friday, the business sells a signature sandwich and side that changes every week. As an avid foodie of I.V., I've been following Friday's grow for a while now on Instagram, and finally had the opportunity to review one of their signature sandwiches on their milestone 10th menu drop before I sprinted off to my already-in-progress Spanish class î sorry, profesora. Friday's operates on a pre-order basis, allowing customers to order the weekly signature sandwich earlier on in the week via a Google Form. The sandwich anticipation builds as you watch the precious dollars you spent vanish into thin air for no immediate reward î and you wonder if it's all worth it and how you'll manage to get through the week† î all before it can be picked up at the designated time of your choosing on Friday! This week's signature sandwich was a Breakfast Sando which I bought for $11.50. The sandwich featured fluffy scrambled eggs, melted cheddar, turkey bacon, fresh green onions, and avocado on a buttery brioche bun topped with chipotle aioli, served with a side of crispy tater tots and aioli,ù according to their Instagram. It's worth noting is that customers also had the ability to make the order vegetarian with no turkey bacon. As I pulled up at my designated pick-up time for my sandwich, I felt like I was about to buy class-A drugs: I was slightly hesitant about what I was getting myself into when I was directed to go to the back of the building to pick up the sandwich goods. To my surprise, I wasn't met by some sketchy, ratchet parking lot, but rather just a somewhat frat-like front yard with a cute blackboard menu sign seen at most caf√©s with a Scrub Daddy-like smiley face drawn on it, letting me know that I was at the right place and that I am safe and secure in its non-existent arms. We both really love to cook, and our friends just said that anything we can make is probably good enough to buy so we decided to start selling it to people in .V.,ù fourth-year economics and Accounting major Joe Mehdizadeh said when I asked him about what inspired the business. Mehdizadeh founded Friday's with Adam Sina, a Biology major at UCSB. The food options in I.V. in general aren't that great, so I think we bring a good curated selection of food everyone likes.ù As I scurried outside with my sandwich like an ant that had just successfully located a measly crumb to bring back to the nest, the next round of people were already walking up to pick up their orders too. There wasn't any seating provided, so I decided to plop myself right in front of the apartment complex by the vibrant green bushes and centuries-old bird poop and dug right in. I have to preface my review by saying that the sandwich was really hard to hold and eat fluidly. The ingredients were like Jenga pieces and fell out of the tower that was my sandwich, because if I don't offer any sort of criticism, I'm going to look like a chump after I ramble on about how satisfying this sandwich was. The Breakfast Sando was a perfect morning meal. The savory flavors of the egg and turkey bacon, combined with the fresh taste of the avocado blended together perfectly to make every bite full of flavor. The melted cheese and the chipotle aioli added a slightly spicy and creamy flavor to the already delicious combination of ingredients in the sandwich, which were held together beautifully in the warm, buttery brioche bun. Maybe it was because I was late for class, but I wolfed down my sandwich in the blink of an eye, relishing each quick bite with gusto. This sandwich definitely deserves a high rating; a solid 8.75/10 rating in my books. The òbreakfast sando' with a side of tater tots. After I devoured the Breakfast Sando at speeds not even Sonic the Hedgehog could match, I moved on to try the crispy tater tots. Having not eaten a tater tot in many months, I was especially excited to try these guys out. Friday's tater tots had that signature crispy, potatoey crunch that everyone loves from one of America's most iconic breakfast items, while also having a soft, flaky interior that melts in your mouth like wax to a flame. They were definitely the perfect sidekick to the Batman that was the Breakfast Sando. My one gripe would be that they could've used a little more salt; however, I must acknowledge that it seems pretty hard to put salt on those stubby cylinder potatoes and expect it to stay. It's well deserving of a solid 7.5/10. All in all, Friday's asserts itself as a must on all I.V. food destination lists, especially for those students already struggling to manage their school workload on top of other day-to-day duties. In my expert medical opinion (I am currently undeclared), a Friday's sandwich is the perfect treat to prevent all forms of depression and anxiety. Definitely don't miss out on the rise of an I.V. cult classic. A version of this article appeared on p.8 of the May 2, 2024 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,OTM presents: a collection of family recipes for Mother's Day,9-May-24,8:00 AM,"['Abigail Monti', 'Urmi Mandal', 'Nina Timofeyeva', 'Pihu Jain']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-09/otm-presents-a-collection-of-family-recipes-for-mothers-day/,"Nothing bonds families like food î there's something uniquely special about sharing homemade meals with those you love. Family favorite recipes passed down through generations often resurface on holidays, as traditions center around large spreads of food. Mother's Day is no exception: the springtime holiday is virtually synonymous with brunch. In preparation for Mother's Day î coming up on Sunday, May 12 î On the Menu writers came together to compile a list of our favorite family recipes. No matter if your family celebrates with breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or any meal in between, the following recipes are sure to add a touch of tradition and love to your Mother's Day festivities. Grandma's biscotti† By Abigail Monti In my family (I'm not sure if this is an Italian thing or if we're just sugar-obsessed), we'll find any excuse to sneak dessert into our meals. Biscotti, twice-baked almond-flavored biscuits, are the perfect example: they're the perfect addition to breakfast spreads, afternoon snacks or post-dinner aperitifs. This is my grandmother's go-to recipe. Try adding dark chocolate chips and dried cranberries for my favorite cookie combination! Yield:† 2-3 dozen cookies Duration: 1 hour Ingredients: Directions: Juicy chicken biryani By Urmi Mandal Chicken biryani has it all: savory rice and succulent chicken. This is my mother's most common recipe for a relatively quick weekend-night home dinner. While exact measurements are written below, true delicious biryani is made with measurements and timings of the heart. Yield: 8 servings Duration: 3 hours Ingredients: Directions: Borscht: the famous beet soup By Nina Timofeyeva Soup is known to be a heartwarming meal and to me, this recipe is especially comforting because of its connection to my grandmother and mom. Borscht is a soup that's very common in Russian culture and is cooked for any and all occasions. Its bright colors and somewhat sweet flavor are sure to cheer up anyone who gives it a try. Opening a thermos of the bright red soup for lunch at school, I felt my mom's affection follow me into the school cafeteria. Some of my happiest memories with extended family were made over bowls of borscht at the house my grandfather built in the Russian countryside. For such an unpretentious dish, borscht certainly surprises with the joy it brings to children, adults and elders alike.† Yield: 8 servings Duration: 2.5 hours Ingredients: For the stock For the borscht Directions: For the stock For the borscht Serve borscht with a dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche and sprinkled with fresh dill or parsley! Paneer tikka pizza By Pihu Jain Paneer tikka pizza is a delightful Indian-American fusion dish that represents my heritage and my upbringing. This recipe is made in our house at least once a week, if not more. It's crazy to think that this recipe is older than me, something born of my mother's mind in India long before she ever stepped foot into the role of motherhood or even into America. But it will always remind me of her, of evenings in the warm glow of my childhood kitchen with my little sister, just a toddler, my dad with flour dusting his nose and my mom instructing me carefully on how to shred cheese without hurting myself. I have modified the recipe to make it more accessible but certainly retain the original flavor and feeling of the dish. Yield: 4 servings Duration: 1.5 hours Ingredients: Directions: For ingredients like paneer and garam masala, you should be able to find those at one of the local international markets. I myself have found garam masala even in the Isla Vista Food Co-op. Enjoy! A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the May 9, 2024 version of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,A sweet legacy: McConnell's Fine Ice Creams celebrates 75th anniversary,16-May-24,10:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/a-sweet-legacy-mcconnells-fine-ice-creams-celebrates-75th-anniversary/,"McConnell's serves freshly scooped ice cream as well as packaged tubs to go. Abigail Monti / Daily Nexus Seventy-five years ago, husband and wife Gordon Macù and Ernesteen Ernieù McConnell had a dream: making the finest ice cream in the world. In 1949, they launched the beloved McConnell's Fine Ice Creams brand and opened their first location on Mission and State Street in December 1950. The McConnell's brand immediately stood apart. At the time, ice creams were packed with artificial flavors, colors, stabilizers, preservatives and sweeteners. In contrast, McConnell's ice cream stuck to the basics, like locally sourced cream, pure cane sugar and simple ingredients. Their artisan homemade base contains 18+% milkfat, a standard higher than most ice creams in the industry. The result? Deliciously dense, smooth and flavorful ice cream. Mac and Ernie McConnell ran the store until 1962 when Mac passed away. Shortly after, Ernie sold McConnell's to Jim and Jeney McCoy. The McCoys built on the company legacy, expanding distribution to new markets in Southern California. In 1975, they purchased The Old Dairy, the largest of 10 family-run dairies that once operated in downtown Santa Barbara. It became (and still is) the McConnell's work headquarters. In 2012, McConnell's was bought by Michael Palmer, a winemaker, and his wife Eva Ein, a chef, and continued operating at The Old Dairy. In 2013, it underwent major renovations to update the ice cream-making equipment. Yet, as the brand expanded, Palmer soon realized they needed more manufacturing power. He oversaw the construction of a new facility in Oxnard 10 times as large as The Old Dairy. Under Palmer and Ein's ownership, the flagship McConnell's Fine Ice Creams store opened at 728 State Street, just down the street from Mac and Ernie's original store. Now, six McConnell's shops exist throughout California's coast, and their products are sold in more than 2,000 grocery stores and markets. They ship pints nationwide and even have a Pint of the Month Club.ù† Unlike most other ice cream brands, McConnell's is also the manufacturer î meaning it makes the cream and is responsible for the ingredients that go into its products. After 70-years, we've learned something: to make the finest ice creams, you must control the process, every step of the way,ù the McConnell's website says. In celebration of the shop's 75th anniversary, Palmer and Ein resurrected four classic flavors from the original shop's menu: Dutchman's Chocolate, Black Coffee Chip, Santa Barbara Strawberry and Sweet Cream. Customers can buy pints of each classic flavor in their iconic 1949 retro striped packaging.† The store also celebrated its anniversary with a 49% discount at all shop locations on Tuesday, May 7 in commemoration of their origin date in 1949. Santa Barbara locals flocked to the store, forming a line down State Street. Now, McConnell's Fine Ice Creams serves over 100 rotating flavors. Popular flavors include Sea Salt Cream & Cookies, Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Eureka Lemon & Marionberries and Earl Grey Tea & Shortbread Cookies. Their menu has also expanded to include cookies, ice cream sandwiches, milkshakes, floats and sundaes. Even as the McConnell's brand has grown, changed owners, expanded locations and added new flavors, their ice cream has remained a timeless symbol of family, tradition, and î of course î unbeatable flavor. Three generations later, McConnell's Fine Ice Cream remains the go-to dessert destination of Santa Barbara County.† Although the special offer has passed, there's no better way to celebrate the end of the school year than with a pint (or two)!

on-the-menu,"Great grub, great taste: Maria's Tacos has it all!",16-May-24,10:00 AM,['Josh Rhodes'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/great-grub-great-taste-marias-tacos-has-it-all/,"Three-empanada special with a hibiscus tea. Josh Rhodes / Daily Nexus To the left of the Chase Bank and the now abandoned building that once housed the famous Study Hall bar on Pardall Road sits Maria's Tacos: a quiet, underground restaurant in Isla Vista. Typically not busy because of its proximity to Freebirds and the Pardall shopping circle (consisting of the neighboring The Habit Burger Grill, Wingstop and Dublin's Sports Grill), Maria's is the perfect place to eat great Mexican food at an affordable price, avoid running into any concerning situationships and dodge other people until you are socially freed by the grace of summer break. I received a good tip from a friend about Maria's from winter quarter and finally decided to pay it a visit last week while I was suffering from extreme midterm procrastination syndrome. The blackboard outside advertised their new deal for three empanadas for only $11. I was stunned at how amazing that deal sounded and knew I had to give Maria's a visit.† The interior has a cute, quaint, almost garden-like atmosphere to it. The all-white walls sport vibrant, floral vine streamers dangling down from the ceiling, which evoke a sense of calm and tranquility from diners. While there isn't much indoor seating at Maria's due to its relatively small size, the bar style seating at the base of the main window overlooking the road was nice to look out on while eating. Overall, I found Maria's very charming, and while I can't say its design helped me vanquish the looming sense of doom developing in my mind as I procrastinated further on my studies, being at Maria's helped me momentarily forget my troubles. After chatting with the cashier about the restaurant and practically stalking the cooks as they prepared my meal î the kitchen is completely visible î I returned to my crusty apartment to eat my three-empanada special featuring carne asada, cilantro, onion, goat cheese, lettuce and chipotle sauce and slurp on a hibiscus tea the shade of wine, all for the price of $15.† As I opened the takeout box containing my empanadas, I was stunned by how much of the box's surface area was covered by the rich, delicious food inside. The empanadas were absolutely enormous. Thinking back, I don't even remember seeing the bottom of the box until after I had eaten one of the empanadas. Furthermore, the empanadas looked absolutely gorgeous. They definitely warranted an Instagram story post as the vibrant yellows, purples, oranges and greens visible on the surface of the empanada looked like a five-star restaurant creation. If you are looking for beautiful, protein-packed and filling takeout food that can last about two meals or can be eaten by three people, Maria's is definitely a great option. The empanada crust was the perfect level of crispy, yet still flexible enough to be held without crushing the entire surface of the shell off. The tangy, slightly spicy chipotle sauce paired excellently with the rich tasting carne asada and goat cheese, which helped bring out the light, slightly crunchy bites of onion and lettuce. My only gripe was that I felt the carne asada lacked some flavor. Overall, I would rate Maria's empanadas an 8/10. The reason I got the hibiscus drink wasn't initially because I thought it would pair well with my empanadas but because I was enchanted by the rich, maroon hue of the hibiscus in the refrigerator next to the register while I was paying. I felt like such a baddie biking back to my apartment looking like a student openly drinking wine from a plastic cup around I.V., so for that alone, I rate the drink highly. I enjoyed experiencing the sweet berry flavors in the beverage while eating my meal; it paired well with the rich tasting empanadas. However, I think I would've struggled to enjoy the drink on its own as the sweetness factor and overall flavor of the beverage quickly became tiring. I think it deserves a 7/10 rating. Wrapping up, I believe that Maria's Tacos is slept on too much by the residents of I.V. Maria's is a 9/10 based largely on how good I felt, as the deal I got on the empanadas was amazing compared to other Isla Vista eateries charging upwards of $15 for less. While my food in my opinion did not taste as incredible as other I.V. eateries, I was extremely satisfied with my meal and will definitely be returning again for more amazing grub and great deals.

on-the-menu,California Strawberry Festival,23-May-24,10:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-23/california-strawberry-festival/,"The festival featured a strawberry shortcake station, offering unlimited toppings. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the California Strawberry Festival, located in the Ventura County Fairgrounds not more than 45 minutes from UCSB. The festival's roots can be traced back to 1983, when Tsujio Kato, a councilman from Oxnard, proposed the festival as a way of celebrating his favorite crop, the festival's namesake strawberry. The $15 ticket certainly felt worth its weight in gold, or should I say, strawberries? From strawberry tamales to beignets, the fruity flavor was incorporated creatively into many different cuisines. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus Walking into the festival was like falling down the rabbit hole with Alice, my sight swirling with colors, passersby transforming from gray and dark denimed forms to brighter pinks and reds, strawberry crocheted hats and cardigans, dresses, the looming gray sky no match for the cheery spirit below. Walking into the festival, I was immediately greeted by the sight of an incredibly large red crowd, dozens upon dozens of food vendors and strawberry snacks of all kinds. Stalls heralded remarkable goods not necessarily related to the fruit but just as enchanting: a man selling porcelain hand crafted night lights, a couple selling their glazed pottery, all the local craftsmen reminding us of the talented artists that Santa Barbara breeds with its dreamy Mediterranean climate and inspirational views of grandeur. While I did not purchase any of the beautiful artworks due to the hole in my wallet, I certainly could not discount the palatable goods that the day had in store. I first found myself gravitating to the strawberry shortcake station, where for just $5 you can assemble the strawberry shortcake tower of your dreams. At least, that's what I did. In a herculean feat, I managed to get several pieces of shortcake, heaps of strawberry syrup, a Mount Everest of strawberries all topped with some delicious whipped cream, in the base of a well-to-do but certainly not large enough plastic bowl. The strawberries, grown locally of course, were some of the most delicious ones I've had this season. A novelty strawberry cup is just an example of the adorable collectibles sported by many a visitor at the festival. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus While parsing the grounds, people watching and snapping photos with the cute props placed around the grounds, I noticed an adorable plastic strawberry-shaped beverage cup with a small strawberry keychain hanging on the outside in the hands of every few people. Inquiry led me to a familiar booth, one I recognized from the Goleta Lemon Festival in September: Sweet Treats, based in Ventura County, specializing in strawberry-flavored delights. They featured strawberry tamales, cupcakes and the aforementioned souvenir cup. Unfortunately, by the time I arrived, the cups were all sold out, but this did not deter me from trying their lemonade, which I found perfectly sweetened and strawberry flavored with all the freshness a natural strawberry lemonade would contain. A bit pricey, for the cost of $7, but let's just say I've seen worse pricing for worse flavor.† The strawberry lemonade packed a powerful, refreshing punch. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus Just before leaving, I decided to indulge in some more desserts, in the form of strawberry kebabs. The kebabs, for the price of $11 each, featured 4-5 strawberries stacked with brownies in between, all lightly drizzled with chocolate. There's a reason this is a tried but true combination, and with the large size and freshness of the strawberries, I was more than happy to pay the price.† With a perfect combination of crisp chocolate and juicy strawberries, the strawberry kebobs drew in a large crowd. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus In my personal opinion, no fruit is more commonplace yet refreshingly unique than the strawberry. This festival reminded me of that, and I'm certain many people will agree with me on this. It was nice to see such cheer when the weather has been so disheartening lately, and I left with a sweeter taste in my mouth and certainly a happier state of mind.

What I don't see are the updates on which restaurants are having deals, which celebrities are announcing new collabs and what new items Trader Joe's will be introducing this season. So, to take a break from the often discouraging headlines, I've gathered up the top food news of the month that may not have made the front page.† Along with having Star Wars characters depicted on the sides of the cookies, the Oreo cookie will tell you whether you're on the dark side or the light side, but only once you open the pack. Upon tearing open the container, you can find cookies filled with either one of two types of creme î each one symbolizing one of the rivaling sides. Sandwiched in between are also kyberù sugar crystals, inspired by the crystals powering their lightsabers. The presale begins May 30, so be sure to get yours in time for the release of the new film Star Wars: The Acolyte.ù Eggo, along with Dominic Ciambrone, are releasing Eggo Fully Loaded Kicks, a sneaker honoring Eggo's new Fully Loaded Waffles. These sneakers come in two òflavors': Chocolate Chip Brownie and Strawberry Delight. Apart from their aesthetics, these sneakers offer a utilitarian feature of a hidden zip stash pocket for bringing along emergency syrup packets. Limited numbers of pairs costing $150 drop on May 17, 24, and 31 at Urban Necessities. The Cheeseburger Melt features beef, bacon, onions, various types of cheese and Burger Sauce. However, this òburger' doesn't have the typical burger bun. Rather, the contents are folded into a thin crust melt, keeping up the company's traditional use of flat breads. Pizza Hut is going so far as to station delivery drivers in cars with huge QR codes around competing burger joints. They will be offering free Cheeseburger Melts to customers throughout Chicago and Miami while supplies last.† Starting May 21, the Grandma McFlurry will be available in stores nationwide. This treat takes vanilla soft serve and adds chopped candy pieces, meant to represent the candies grandmas are known to carry around with them to spoil their grandchildren. McDonald's will also be releasing the Grandma McFlurry through the Grandma's McFlurry Mobile, the company's take on the traditional ice cream trucks our grandmas may have grown up with. These trucks will be offering the new item before it becomes available in restaurants. To really drive the message home, McDonald's will also be working with Spotify to release two new remakes of songs that grandma may have listened to: How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)ù covered by Remi Wolf and Piel Canelaù covered by Jay Wheeler.† The two iconic companies will be coming together to present Jell-O Girl Scout Pudding Cups, in flavors of Caramel Coconut and Thin Mints. These snacks offer Jell-O's creamy pudding with a side of crunchy Girl Scout cookies, a pairing that will satiate all the possible desires of your sweet tooth. These treats will now allow cookie lovers to enjoy their favorites outside of Girl Scout cookie selling season! Of course, we had to include Florida, or else it wouldn't be a true news round up. Florida's governor Ron DeSantis has called the movement towards artificially produced meat a global eliteù plan aimed at advancing authoritarian goals. This legislation appears to be the first of its kind, but is expected to act as an example for other states such as Alabama, Tennessee and Arizona. The quickly growing industry of artificial meat production currently contains 43 companies in the U.S, two of which are FDA approved for retail sale. The ban was justified by supporters as a means of protecting the beef industry, but others are upset that this ban diminishes consumer freedom of choice and prevents developments in biotechnology. Hopefully these news brightened up the gloomy month of May for you just a little bit. While of course we'd love to be seeing more news like this in our news feeds, I suppose staying updated on what the males of the Sunshine State are up to will have to do.† A version of this article appeared on p. 16 of the May 23, 2024, print edition of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Signing off the menu: a reflection of my experience in food journalism,30-May-24,3:22 PM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-30/116816/,"Abigail Monti will be graduating with UC Santa Barbara's class of 2024. Courtesy of Abigail Monti Like any 2020 high school graduate will tell you, trying to find my niche in college was far from easy. As a student athlete, I was lucky enough to live on campus freshman year despite remote instruction, but I still felt disconnected from the university community. So when sophomore year came around, I was determined to throw myself at every campus opportunity I had the slightest interest in. After one weird English Club meeting (I didn't realize clubs still enforce the raise-your-hand rule) and a brief stint with Her Campus magazine (is it weird to say I missed working in a co-ed environment?), I was scrambling for something new.† Enter the Daily Nexus. I wrote a long-winded email to the On the Menu (OTM) editors at the time, Chace Duma and Michelle Lee, inflating my writing abilities even though I had no practical experience in journalism. Honestly, I might have even attached my resume. I was prepared to endure any application and hiring process necessary. Of course, Michelle quickly wrote back, explaining that you actually didn't need any experience to join the Daily Nexus. That was the beauty of the student-run publication: it was there to help students gain confidence in their writing, not to produce perfect content.† After I became an editor myself, I sent similar replies to dozens of applicationsù to OTM, each time with a smile. I remember the relief and support I felt when I read Michelle's email. To this day, the come one, come allù philosophy of the Nexus is one of the things I appreciate the most about it. For students without experience and no time for full-time work, the Nexus is a godsend.† The only prerequisites were passion and a desire to learn. Though there are 12 sections of the paper and even more teams behind the scenes, I quickly knew which two passions I would follow: sports and food. I juggled both sections for the better part of sophomore year until I found out it was a conflict of interest to write about the track team (I mean, can you blame me? No one else does). But making the full-time switch to OTM turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. I had more time to explore writing styles that pushed my comfort zone. I learned how to conduct proper interviews, write cookbook and restaurant reviews and report on local food events.† Perhaps more importantly, I learned to find my voice. For most newspaper sections, keeping a formal, objective tone is paramount; but there were no such limitations with OTM. In fact, I was encouraged to write in the way that felt most authentic to me. As an English major with a predisposition toward creative writing styles, this was a freeing revelation. I started steeping my articles with humor, casual interjections, unconventional syntax and more colons and em dashes than any self-respecting reporter would ever use. OTM became a place for me to experiment with the strategies I was learning in the classroom in a non-academic setting. I could write about any topic I chose (as long as it was food-related, which wasn't hard for me; food is always close to mind) and in any way I chose. I also got paid for it î incredible.† My promotion to assistant OTM editor and eventually lead OTM editor gave me even more opportunities to challenge myself. If I thought running was hard, it was nothing compared to the chaos of learning how to use InDesign (shoutout to my co-editor Stephanie Gerson and the entire production team for having endless patience with me). I spent long Tuesday nights in the office, wrote last-minute articles when our staff writers flaked and even appeared in a few TikToks despite a general fear of being perceived online. But the Nexus team made all these challenges worth it. A college newsroom with zero adult supervision looks a lot like you would expect it to î chaotic, raunchy and reliably stocked with alcohol î† and yet, it was also one of the most driven, disciplined and supportive environments I've ever had the honor of working in. It was the campus community I'd always dreamed of. I don't think leaving the Nexus will truly feel real until I've chalked my name on the wall alongside the dozens of editors who once called that dilapidated office their home. But even though I know that day will be a bittersweet one, I'm so grateful for the time I got to spend there, and I'm even more excited to see what the rising OTM editors, Pihu Jain and Nina Timofeyeva, will do next. If anyone embodies the creative ambition of the Nexus, it's them. A version of this article appeared on p. 14 of the May 30, 2024, print edition of the Daily Nexus.

on-the-menu,Strawberry Avocado Toast: A Summer Delight,18-Jul-24,10:00 AM,['Pihu Jain'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-07-18/117146/,"† A perfect blend of the sweet and savory, this recipe is sure to delight on a hot summer's day. Pihu Jain / Daily Nexus Whenever I wake to the sweet smell of coffee and a ruckus in the kitchen, it only means one thing: dad is cooking. My father has a flair for the dramatic. Though he is a quiet man, he certainly makes his presence known ‰∏ especially in the kitchen. From his hands I have tried many a combination, including but not limited to lentils and rice with yogurt and sugar, sesame seed cookies, small cubes of bread toasted with diced onions, and his most famous one which I share with you now, the strawberry avocado toast. That is exactly what I found in my kitchen on one particular morning just a few months ago, and after scolding him for spoiling my newly-purchased farm fresh strawberries in another one of his insane schemes, I relented to his unwavering, mischievous smile and urges of just try it.ù I did more than just try it. I ate not only his piece, but finished the entire mix altogether. It's just incredible, the sweet and savory tango of the avocado and strawberry, the salt conducting and the pepper spicing up the whole affair. I certainly believe everyone needs to try this recipe, so don't be shy and get started with it below! Strawberry Avocado Toast Yields: 2-3 Ingredients: Instructions: Surprisingly, I have found that this recipe works with many different fruits. I especially love the combination with kiwis, since it gives the appearance of a regular avocado toast but surprises you with that sweet-sour tangy combination. Honestly, any fruit with a medium sweetness level and perhaps some more citrusy or acidic notes can work perfectly in place of a strawberry in this dish. Certainly, this is the most refreshing breakfast combo, perfect for the summer heat we find ourselves in. Enjoy!  Œî  Œî
